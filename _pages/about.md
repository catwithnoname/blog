It's a cat, silly. See:
<img src="http://www.catwithnoname.com/images/catten.jpg" />

She looks like that when she slides down behind the couch and her hair gets ruffled up. And what is her name? It might be catwithnoname, or it might be that she is a cat with no name. She often goes by "tiny", "the tiny", "beast", "wicked", "critter" or "small". She likes biting and red ribbons. Carrots are good, too.
