noooo. So careful I was, but I uploaded the test theme into the live folder and overwrote it! Useless!! So I have to use the default theme for now.

edit: I got the new theme readable but I'm still working on it to make it sensible. The default is so.... default that I had to get rid of it as soon as possible. Maybe later I'll get  the old files from the old theme. I think they exist in a backup somewhere. 

edited edit: I think I like it, and I can't see any terrible terrible bugs. It started out as a blatant <a href="http://www.twitter.com">twitter</a> copy (going for really plain with a vector image on the left) but it seems to have its own spirit now.
