Well, my spouse has been committing <a href="http://darrenlinacre.com/">bloggery</a> and also started up a geekidentity as <a href="http://www.beardygamer.com/">Beardy Gamer</a> (also as @beardygamer).

I've been working as the front end web designer for <a href="http://www.mattressonline.co.uk/">Mattress Online.co.uk</a> since late Jan 2011. This is 100% full of WIN compared to CC. There's a lot of admin - which I think nowdays you have to expect with almost any job - and also crazy fun like getting to take photos and edit photos but get PAID for it. 

I have two main parallel job requirements I guess - creating and maintaining products online, and creating satellite websites. The product side involves photography of products, editing manufacturer product pics, LOADS of XML work (pretty easy XML editing, no XSL or XPATH or anything interesting like that. Just be well formed, dude) and keeping prices / stocklists up to date. The satellite site thing is much more in depth and interesting, as I get to poke loads of html and css and js with a stick and make something presentably professional, I hope. There is a good quality backend db / cms sort of thingy, made by the good quality backend dev - so I am really very front end. I noticed on Thursday it used Scriptaculous / Prototype to do some frontend pretties, which is half a bummer because I am fond of jQuery and half a good thing because at least it seems pretty similar to jQuery.

I don't even have a telephone on my desk. Callcentre is gone nao, kthxbai. So:
