The first day we woke up at about 730 am - a long sleep in for me, considering I normally get up at 6 am. I'd have gotten up later still - I normally take about 7 - 9 minutes to get ready in the morning *l*  but Darren needs longer to get ready - so I read quite a bit after I got up. I had a sore back from the cramped bed, but as soon as I started walking about that seemed to go away. 

We met at 0830 in the main courtyard by the accomodation. A group of about 15 or 20 of us headed to the bus stop. At this point Darren and I decided to get a weekly bus pass rather than cycle, since it seemed like the sociable thing to do... and the passes were cheap, too. Â£14 for unlimited travel within York is pretty good. The bus service we took from the university ran every ten minutes for most of the day. What more could you ask for?

We arrived and got introduced quickly to everyone who was in our group. We were given the introductory lectures (which took all morning) on the history of the site and the basics we needed to know before digging. The person who gave the lecture was due to leave at any time, as his wife was "about to drop a sprog" as one of the others put it. He didn't get a call during the lectures though so thankfully we weren't forgotten quickly as he had to run off... Apparently she did have the child in the earlier hours of the next morning. 

During lunch we ran off into town, where I hurriedly bought some steel toe capped boots - our site counted as a contruction site and steel toecapped boots, hard hats, and yellow vests are a legal requirement, which I hadn't been aware of. Stoopid foreigners.  Darren also took the chance to buy a fleece and a pair of waterproof trousers that were nice and breathable. Once we'd done all this and bought lunch we raun out of lunchtime, so all I had was a quick few bites of my sandwich before we went on site. The area our group was supposed to be working on was <a href="http://picasaweb.google.co.uk/yochannah/HungateOurPhotos/photo#5238191615063736850">utterly waterlogged</a>, so we worked on a different area that afternoon, <a href="http://picasaweb.google.co.uk/yochannah/HungateOurPhotos/photo#5238191697848883874">cleaning</a> back the soil to look for any obvious features or "contexts" as they were known. Any finds we found at that point couldn't count for much, since they were loose on the topsoil rather than clearly embedded and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stratification_%28archeology%29">stratified</a>. We still did find some bone and a bit of a nail, as well as a few bits of pot. 

We had to clean our feet off very carefully when we were leaving the dig site and going back to the main warehouse, which was across the street - the local council wouldn't have taken kindly to a large track of mud between the dig site and the warehouse for some strange reason... Our trowels came in quite handy for digging into the tread of our boots. 

We stopped at the White Swan (or was it back swan? I can't remember...) afterward for a quick drink with everyone else. It was one of those sucky pubs that had nothing I like to drink so I ended up with a crappy orange juice. We chatted with one of the placements and - small world as it is - I found out he used to work for HBoS, so he actually knew who FSC were and what I did as a job. 

We cleared out after not too long, headed home, and ate dinner at the pub near the uni campus again. We also managed to get our rooms sorted - two adjacent, unoccupied rooms in the "quiet house". The move didn't take long since we'd only been in our other room one night. I don't think we actually went into the other room apart from once at the start and once at the end to take / put back the bed. Once we had two single beds side by side I slept faaaaaaaar better. 

We were chagrined to find out that the uni didn't have a wifi connection available, we couldn't use the cabled connection without a uni logon, and there was almost no signal in my 3g usb modem! Mostly we ended up just reading in our free time even though we had darren's mum's laptop and my Eee.
