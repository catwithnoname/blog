Eeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee! Eeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee! Eeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee!!!!!!


I browsed forums (as I did so many hours of my Eeeless existence) looking for some light, somewhere to find an Eee-seller who actually had Eee stock. I eventually got the impression that the best place was NOT the internet for some reason - many stores will say no stock online but have some lurking in a warehouse or storefront somewhere. I looked up Toys-R-Us in sheffield (and is soooo close to work), gave them a ring, and yippee! rushed out to get a train to sheffield *lol*. It's a white one, not a black, but you can't win em all.
