I finally got around to uploading them! <br />
<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.catwithnoname.com/photos/scotland4/">Gallery 4</a> - the one where we jump over the puddles!</li>
<li><a href="http://www.catwithnoname.com/photos/scotland5/">Gallery 5</a> - notice the conversion from dry dog to wet dog all of a sudden. Lesson: don't skip stones near Min. </li>
<li><a href="http://www.catwithnoname.com/photos/scotland6/">Gallery 6</a> - beach and castle, mostly. </li>
<li><a href="http://www.catwithnoname.com/photos/scotland7/">Gallery 7</a> - a shorter one, mostly dog faces (and no our cat doesn't live in Scotland but she's so cute she got included too!). Who knows why Darren needed to take a pic of the tv with that book / cafe / Pamela Anderson show on...  </li>
</ul>
