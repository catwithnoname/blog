Evil combo. The internet says to me <a href="http://images.google.co.uk/images?hl=en&q=compiz&btnG=Search+Images&gbv=2">Compiz</a> (click on it for some screenshots) will make my computer beautiful and wonderful and the cube will spin and dance gracefully. My computer says "no, not really, I'd rather grind to a painful halt". Nord might be able to tell me what I've done wrong..... but for the meantime, I've deleted Compiz. DIE Compiz DIE!!
