That the bedroom is no longer like <a href="http://picasaweb.google.com/yochannah/BedroomBeforePlaster#">this</a>? We got it plastered a few months ago, and it's still got a mottled beige sorta colour all over it. We're actually using the room as our bedroom. I might try to get some more pics of it as it is, plastered but unpainted. Then when we do finally paint it we'll have before, middle, and after pics.
