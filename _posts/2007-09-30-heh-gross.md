<a href="http://www.google.co.uk/search?hl=en&q=gloves+wipe+patch&btnG=Search&meta=">Have a look at this google search</a>. I've just discovered that cycling gloves are actually *intended* to wipe you nose with. *lol* I was certain it happened anyway - I recall joking to a colleague who complained about a runny nose while biking, telling her she's just have to wash her gloves more often - but I didn't know they were purpose-made with "wipe patches". I noticed something that implied their existence when I was reading my mountainbike magazine, (the mag's hardcore, life-and-death biking on mountain edges and stuff like that, I mostly bought it for the spanner it came with), and then when I was browsing <a href="http://www.hikebikeandride.com/">hikebikeandride.com</a> (what a cool URL!!) I came across the mention of them again so decided to hunt for more explicit evidence. And there it was! I actually find them more practical than gross, to tell the truth. I certainly find their existence amusing.
