IE has done terrible things to wordpress!!!!!!!!
Let us hope that resizing those pics will fix it.
Moral of the story is NEVER USER IE!

**edit** fixed them. IE won't like this page unless all images are 450px or less. I stand by me previous statement.. No IE.

[I was going to insert a big firefox banner here but it was 468 pixels long *lol* so here:]
<a href="http://www.spreadfirefox.com/?q=affiliates&amp;id=0&amp;t=214"><img src="http://sfx-images.mozilla.org/affiliates/Buttons/firefox2/firefox-spread-btn-3.png" alt="Firefox 2" title="Firefox 2" border="0" /></a>

[Note IE doesn't display this correctly either. The PNG transparency is just too much for it. FF shows it without those silly shaded corners.]

Oh cool, there's even a <a href="http://lug.oregonstate.edu/index.php/Projects/Firefox/Firefox_Circle">firefox crop circle</a>!
