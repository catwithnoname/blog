we have a small store of anti-apocalypse food. It's mostly for a nuclear one though, cos it's in our under-the-stairs cupboard  that has no walls shared with the outside, so is our designated fallout shelter. It's got a sleepingbag in there too. Also lots of shoes, so it might be uncomfy if the world did blow up. 

I would barricade myself in the attic if the zombies got in the house cos the stairs would be easy to defend. They're very steep and narrow. I'd probably starve to death up there though. Need to get some food put in there in case.

And I think the "check the windows to see if it was a zombie" was referring to the case of a sombie apocalypse, not just RL... *L*
