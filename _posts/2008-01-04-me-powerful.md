Well they have women's tops now: <a href="http://store.mozilla.org/category.php?catid=9">Mozilla Store</a>. No idea what "Miro" is, and there's not a very good selection. It looks to me like they've just tucked in the guy's miro one a bit and taken another photo. the pink on the "foxy" top can't be denied though. (yech.)

Nonetheless, I have clout! I am powerful!!! bwahahahahaha.
