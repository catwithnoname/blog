For starters, it was the most unenjoyable walk I have ever been on. *lol* It's mostly a funny memory now but I got really stressed (and lost......).

I got off at Chinley and found the start of the route easily. There was a fairytale appletree with one sole rosy red apple on it.

If a travelling prince picked it he would get cursed by the dryad of the tree and bound into eternal slavery. Or perhaps a youngster out to seek his fortune would be given the apple as a reward for a kind deed to a squirrel, and following the deed he will be recognised by all trees as a kind person and given bountiful fruits, nuts and berries, so long as he keeps the apple with him - and it always stays fresh.... 

After a very short while I got to a bit that directed me to go on the footpath to the right. The road forked and I took the right fork, but in my head tarmac on road doesn't equal "footpath", so I took the next right which occurred prettymuch immediately as well. Bad choice, apparently. I should have taken the tarmac, and eventually I admitted this was a bad idea. On the way I saw some fun stuff. A spider in a web, which was sneaky and ran away when I snapped the photo. Some <a href="http://www.catwithnoname.com/photos/chinley1/images/05092007231.jpg">lichen</a>, which was strange, because I don't think I've seen it in the UK before. It's common in Israel, on stones, where there are newer colourful ones and old dead sunbleached lichens all grown over each other.  Maybe I don't see it so much here because of the damp. This would make sense, because the lichen I saw was under a ledge. 

(Interlude: the kitten's lying under my desk by my feet! She's so lovely.) 

There were lots of spider web packet thingies: <img src="http://www.catwithnoname.com/photos/chinley1/images/05092007234.jpg" width="450" height="338"/>

And a super cool web with water in it. <img src="http://www.catwithnoname.com/photos/chinley1/images/05092007236.jpg" width="450" height="338"/>

Once I had turned back, I found the correct turnoff pretty easily again. As soon as I'd gotten over the wall, I decided my make my bladder a bit happier. When I was getting back up a nettle got in between my left hand and my thigh, and the two brushed together, causing me to get stung on both sides. Owwwwwww. I continued on through a beautiful area full of sheep, blooming gorse, and slate.
