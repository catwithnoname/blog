Cos it kinda sneakeded up on me. time just flies sometimes. I've not worked at the hospital for almost a year... or is it a whole year? I don't recall. My CV probably knows. I'm glad that time is behind me cos it involved too much stress. My current job is stress free. Completely.

It's been about three hours since I started this, and I'm struggling to continue now. Jorge Garcia is on TV atm on Becker. It's the only thing he's really in that I know apart from Lost but he seems interesting.

I really should go to Halford's today but I can't be bothered. My gears aren't changing properly still - it might take a few tries and lots of clacking noises or it might change straight away. Still quite bikeable, so one day when I'm particularly annoyed at it I'll go in and get it fixed, but not until then. John (who lives in worksop) passed me in his car on the way to work the other day. I had asked him if I could get a ride with him until the train was back up but he'd said it wasn't convenient originally. I think when he find out that my next choice (after finding out how bad bus transport is) was biking he felt bad cos he emailed me and offered me a ride after all, but I'm stubbornly set in my bikingly ways now I think. Apart from the saddle soreness.

Oh yeah! a whine: there are FAR too many debt / loan ads on TV. I hate them!!! They either try to portray the stress of already being in debt, and explain how there's hope in the future with one consolidated easy to pay loan that'll have you out of debt in just 60 easy monthly payments, or they make it seem like the most natural and good thing in the world to take out a debt to spend on unnecessary frivolities, as though loans are money for free. I also get a large amount of junkmail that is just a waste of paper offering to make my dreams come true with an easy loan. Being a homeowner definitely makes me more eligible for a Halifax Personal Loan, it seems. Do you want that house extension you never dreamed you could afford? What about that magical trip around the world? Sell your soul to us!!

I don't have a problem with appropriate loans. I'd never have been able to afford my house without a mortgage, for example. If I was starting a business up, I'd get a business loan. Student loans are often necessary too. But just to get some more money to spend on "stuff"? Ick. I think loans are on my list of pet hates (where ever did that term come from?) including tanning, smoking, and boozeeverynight culture.

I'm terrified I'll get tanned despite sunscreen and long clothing when applicable, because the bikeriding makes me out in the sun a lot. If I get tanned-er and someone thinks they should mention it, it might be the last thing they do. *L*

Oh yes, last thing. Finished Eragon, it was ok. Now, I'm on <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/1841492914?ie=UTF8&tag=cat09-21&linkCode=as2&camp=1634&creative=6738&creativeASIN=1841492914">Shadowplay (Shadowmarch Trilogy)</a><img src="http://www.assoc-amazon.co.uk/e/ir?t=cat09-21&l=as2&o=2&a=1841492914" width="1" height="1" border="0" alt="" style="border:none !important; margin:0px !important;" />, which is the second Shadow book by Tad Williams. The first one fell into the MS&T category, which is "not great but I read it anyway" unlike Otherland, which was on its own in "Innovative idea, worth the read" or War of the Flowers which was "Pretty Damned Good". Hopefully this one will be OK. I was a bit disappointed that the second one didn't have a synopsis of the first book. I'm pretty sure that all of Tad's other stuff does!
