First of all, thanks to all the nice people who congratulated me on my test. I'm utterly oozingly happy with my result (despite Henry saying he's surprised I'm satisfied with it!)

I went out biking again with the Rotherham wheelers last sunday and didn't do too badly. I paid membership fees (see <a href="http://www.rotherhamwheelerscc.co.uk/p_People.ikml">my name</a> on the list?) and everything! I felt a bit bad because I was slower than the rest of the group, and Mahmood ended up splitting off from the rest of the group to cycle with the slow poke. They say that's the idea of the sunday group - to be the slow ones - but it seems that everyone in the group is supderduper fast anyway. I know I'm fitter than the average bear - I did nearly 40 miles in about 3 hours on sunday - so it seems to me the group can't be too terribly slow and newbie like anyway. They all tell me it'll be a lot easier once I get a roadbike, but I really can't afford the expenditure right now. I think in an ideal world I've have four bikes - my current Carrera Subway II hybridey one, my Brompton folder, a road bike, and a mountain bike with full suspension. Tentatively, I'd also like to try a recumbent. I hate how tempting credit cards are, but I'm determined not to use credit just because I can, no matter how much I would like to. Save instead. 

Anyway, back the the ride on sunday. I fell off! It involved a severe case of idiocy... I wasn't paying enough attention, my wheel skidded along against the kerb, and all of a sudden I lost my balance. I landed on my head and shoulder, and ended up with a lightly grazed chin and an annoying dry & itchy friction burn on my shoulder - thankfully my jersey wasn't damaged. I love that jersey. (Thankyou, Linda!! It was one of the most thoughtful gifts...) The helmet took the brunt of the fall, but I had a headache for a while afterwards. I'm not sure exactly how, but when I got up, I wasn't attached to my bike, despite no memories of having unclipped from the pedals. I guess the impact wrenched my feet off. 

Afterwards, I was pooped as pooped can be. I had a nap, and I ate lots of food. Poor mahmood offered to share a Jordans yummy apple & berry bar with me, and I wolfed it down in moments. At home I had two bowls of pasta for lunch as well - considering I normally have a small graze box for lunch that was load and loads, as well as the two Lucozades and the larger than normal breakfast. I sincerely wonder if my exercise-driven need to eat drove me to eat a lot more calories than I burned in the first place. If only bodies came with little LCDs that told you what you'd taken in and what you'd sweated out. Perhaps they could even say when you had to refuel, or how much to eat before a specific exercise to ensure you had the fuel you needed. I shall have to put them in the scifi novel I never really intend to write.

I seem to have agreed to participate in a race next sunday. It's a race for road bikey people, and I don't even HAVE a road bike, so I shan't be suprised to come last, but it shall be fun anyway. It's been many years since I've done any sport in a competitive way.

I've purchased some dissoluble tablets to put into water to try instead of premixed sports drinks like lucozade, for when I exercise. I won't get a chance to try them until the race on Sunday.... in fact, maybe I should try them now, in case they are disgusting, so I can buy lucozade instead if they taste nasty. Then again, when I'm not working out, I don't like lucozade much at all anyway. But you drink whatever's available when you're sweating like a pig, and it tastes like the sweetest, finest drink in the world.

 Do pigs sweat? I just realised that's a weird phrase. Thinking about it more, I know israeli wild boars tend to go out more during twilight rather than daytime, because they DON'T sweat. Strange. 

I got mildly sunburned, too, despite the SPF 50 sunscreen. Useless whitegirl. It's a shame that summer weight long sleeve and long leg garments don't exist - if they're long they tend to be thick and warm, for winter. Doesn't anyone care about skin cancer, and about not looking like a leather bag years before it's due?
