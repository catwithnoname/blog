Wednesday I went to the Peak District for my walkerisifying. To be strict, I went there to walk OR bike, without knowing which I would do. The weather outlook was dim; I didn't think it would be wise to go walking on the peaks if it was pouring, or more importantly, if it was foggy.

Quick tangent  - My <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/Gelert-Summit-Rucksack-Navy-Blue/dp/B000EQGUC2">backpack</a> is a new and yummy one that I really really like - quality walking/biking/active lifestyle gear really rocks my world. Gelert tends to be cheap but from my experience good quality and still technical fabrics and designs. This is hydration system compatible, and I have a couple of hydration pouches, but the backpacks they come with are so small! A 35L bag that's compatible expands my carrying capacity greatly. It saves a lot of time and bother to just sip the straw that is sticking over your shoulder. Gone are the days of taking the bottle out of the bag, opening it, returning it to the bag, and not drinking for another hour. My bag also has a nifty steel frame that takes the bulk of the pack out of direct contact with my back, meaning I'm less sweaty.  It has a raincover (vital, remember my phone got fried?), durable fabric, and two side pockets that could fit 1.5L or 2L bottles. And it's blue.

To go back to Wednesday, I decided to pack bikestuff and walkingstuff, and bike if the weather said No Walking, or lock the bike up at the train station if the weather said Peak Walking is Ok. When I got there, I could see that the peaks were damp but not foggy, so the bike got left behind. I now have <a href="http://leisure.ordnancesurvey.co.uk/leisure/productDetails.jsp?item=13545&amp;q=dark%20peak"> the Ordinance Survey's OL1 Dark Peak map</a> which was extra super handy. I wouldn't have been able to do the walk without it. I'd used a route from <a href="http://www.walkingbritain.co.uk">WalkingBritain.co.uk</a>, specifically <a href="http://www.walkingbritain.co.uk/walks/walks/walk_b/1264/">this one</a>. Now the routes I've used before have been very descriptive and didn't need a map, but they were from a different site. Walking Britain will say things like "go south" instead of "go left" which can be tricky without map / compass facilities.

I know now which way north is in the area, and I'm pretty good about keeping my head on and knowing where I am, but in the middle of moors covered in heather and peat there're often few landmarks and it's easy to get turned about.

The start of my route involved a lot of Up through leafy green-ness. Once I exited the leafy tree area, I got assaulted by <a href="http://www.catwithnoname.com/photos/kinder15082007/images/15082007100.jpg">neekerbreekers</a>, which flew <a href="http://www.catwithnoname.com/photos/kinder15082007/images/15082007103.jpg">everywhere</a> (those numerous black dots don't manage to represent the true amount of teeming black flies) and made me scared to open my mouth lest one fly in. I know at least one landed in my hair. Eventually I got even further Up, and out of their way. I walked for half an hour or so and ended up resting for a bit whilst eating tuna with sweet chili and reading <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/185798787X?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=cat09-21&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1634&amp;creative=6738&amp;creativeASIN=185798787X">Salt</a><img src="http://www.assoc-amazon.co.uk/e/ir?t=cat09-21&amp;l=as2&amp;o=2&amp;a=185798787X" style="border: medium none  ! important; margin: 0px ! important" border="0" height="1" width="1" /> (a short sci fi book that I'm sure any Banks fan would enjoy).

I continued further along the route, through boggy peaty moors, and found out how "In places this path suffers from being wet underfoot but is well defined for most of the way." With a viewpoint like that, I'd feel safe to say that deserts occasionally suffer from some dryness. I had a fight with a peat bog that resulted in <a href="http://www.catwithnoname.com/photos/kinder15082007/images/15082007118.jpg">my leg being wet and peaty to the knee</a>. I think I could have gotten stuck in there if I hadn't been extremely wary, and already prepared to jump out. 

This moor was really big, so I had to have another rest and a chicken/sweetcorn sandwich. And more Salt, of course. I wasn't more than 20 or 30 minutes, but when I looked up..... they sky was black!!! was it night time already? nope, just a big bad storm. The peaks  started to fog over with the low clouds. I got soaked even through my raincoat (it was a cheap Nike one most likely to be seen on chavs...) so I think I want a nice technical fabric professional walker or biker one. I don't have ANY money to spend on one at all, so I'm not even going to look. I always get mopey when my greed says Gimme! Gimme! Gimme! and I can't have. Luckily, I was closer to Jacob's Ladder, the path descending from the mountains, than I had realised, so I managed to get down lower before the fog got to where I was. The path was rocky, with lots of water running over it and between the rocks. I had to descend slowly cos a broken leg on a lonely peak didn't sound like much fun. I knew I was ok if I did get hurt - while I was not able to use my phone, with no signal in the valley, I had seen two walkers about 4 minutes behind me. 

It dried up not long after, so I sped up a bit. near the end of the journey I found some shelf fungus (see the <a href="http://www.catwithnoname.com/photos/kinder15082007/">album</a> for all the pics ' n ' stuff) which just looked nifty. I think I'll try to identify it, if I can... (pause, rifling through nature books) it might be a young crepidotus variabilis, My book says it normally grows on dead trees, though, which makes me unsure. 

My train left at 18:06, I got there at 18:13. Damn. I ended up eating at <a href="http://www.theramblerinn.co.uk/">The Rambler Inn</a> to kill time, and got the next train at 19:28. Cool day. Similar planned for next wed too!
