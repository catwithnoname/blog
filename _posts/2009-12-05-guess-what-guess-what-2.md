Most people I know won't have to guess, since I've plastered Facebook, Twitter, all my IM statuses with it, but I got a letter saying I'd been accepted for British Citizenship in the post this afternoon. I need to call up Notts county council to arrange my Ceremony ASAP, as if it's not performed within three months you need to reapply. (Ack!! another Â£720!?!? how could anyone possibly miss it?) 

They even got my name right, after the initial Linacre mixup. I'll finally have the right name in a passport for the first time since I left NZ and changed my name to Yochannah (from Yohannah, which just looks weird to my eyes nowdays). My Israeli passport doesn't have my middle name (Joy) in it for some reason. But my British documentation shall have Joy, and shan't have Linacre. It shall be Correct. Finally. 

Next stop: red passport. Wheeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee!

I am so so so so so so so so so happy to have my life as I would choose to make it accepted, legally and (prettymuch) irrevocably.
