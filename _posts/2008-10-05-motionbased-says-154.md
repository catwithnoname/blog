Got home yesterday at not too long past ten.... shower+bed was all that was really in order. Yesterday was definitely the easiest of the three days. At the very start there were two uphill sections which I really struggled with - not because they were big, but I think mostly to do with mental exhaustion since I'd had a LOT of ups and downs the day before. Once I got up the second one of those, there was a sweet moorland path - the <a href="http://www.durham.gov.uk/durhamcc/usp.nsf/pws/Durham+Wildlife+Sites+-+Waskerley+Way">Waskerley Way</a>. It's an ex railway, like many popular biking trails. I was doing it all downhill - just very slightly, never steep. It was lovely zooming along the gravelly track, nothing but wind and heather all around. The wind was so strong to the left that I was constantly adjusting my direction to account for the fact that I'd been blown to the left slightly.... I had to stay to the very right of the track to be sure it wouldn't try to blow me off in a sudden extra strong gust. The Waskerley Way ended not long before Consett. Part of it went over the <a href="http://www.forgottenrelics.co.uk/bridges/gallery/hownesgill.html">Hownsgill viaduct</a>, which was so high I felt intimidated whilst looking down from it, despite the perfectly secure railings. 

At Consett there was a loooovely sign saying I only had 23 miles to go to Sunderland. After another 20 minutes or so of cycling I came across a sign saying 19 miles, then within five minutes of that, came signs saying 20 miles, and then another saying 17 miles in quick succession. I'll be darned if there were 500 meters between the last three, never mind the backwards counting... 

Between Consett and Sunderland was a lot of interesting art - mostly rusty steel things - such as the four <a ref="http://www.c2c-guide.co.uk/gallery_pages/gall_beanishcows.htm">cows</a> near Beamish. While the route ran through cities and towns it was almost always secluded and separated off so there wasn't any road navigation required - just sitting and pedalling every now and then (but not too much cos it's mostly downhill).

Between the points where there were 20 miles left up until 10 miles to go I was full of victory bubbliness. I know I smirked and laughed and giggled far more than could possibly be needed. Once I'd actually gotten to the end it'd all run out, since I was soaked, muddy, could smell myself, etc. It had rained prettymuch all day - the front was progressing from west to east, just like me, but I wasn't fast enough to avoid it. 

I'm not stiff almost at all, which is a wee bit crazy. Nor am I saddle sore....  

And back to work tomorrow!!
