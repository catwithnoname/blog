I'm watching Never mind the Buzzcocks, and Bonnie Tyler, a guest on the episode, appears to be completely drunk... Maybe she needs a rehab hero. 

A few random things today. On Monday evening I opened a jar of mushroom antipasto and was happily scooping it out onto plate when I noticed a strange dark thing. At first I thought it was just a darkish shroom, but not for long - it was a whole cricket nearly as long as my little finger!! I actually double checked the ingredients first to make sure that crickets weren't a traditional part of the dish, but when I noticed the "suitable for vegetarians" I was pretty well convinced, and I promptly freaked out and went to show Darren. We then phoned up Domino's and ordered pizza instead...

I had an eye test today and got told don't need new glasses, which is pretty good. I had been having some headaches when I'd not been wearing my glasses and gotten into my head that maybe my eyes had gotten worse. I'm going to buy some sports glasses in any case - I want something really specific. I need wraparound ones that act like a wind shield would for a car - stopping rain and flying dust and bugs from getting into my eyes when I cycle. The problem with my current non-prescription ones is that they fog up very quickly, which makes sense when you are sweaty and exercising. A tiny bit more ventilation, carefully placed so you don't ruin the wind shield effect, would be ideal - and I hope that the prescription lenses will make me get less headaches... I can't just get normal prescription sunglasses cos I'd sit on them and they'd break and that would be that. I need robustness!!

Oh, you know what's really awesome? When a firstline helpdesk analyst sees a pop-up and actually <em>installs</em> "Anti Virus 2009" spyware on a user's PC. Guaranteed to give you giggles for days when you think about it. "Don't worry ma'am, I'll fix your PC, here's some spyware..."

The heavens opened yesterday on the way home from work. I was only cycling for 10-15 minutes back to the train station, and it was dry when I left, but it rained soooooooooo hard I was wetter than any of the days on the C2C. It had passed by the time I got to the train station, but in a nifty way, the train caught up with the front, passed under it, and got to Worksop while it was still dry. I raced home and within a minute or so of getting into the house it was pouring. I've never been hit by the same storm twice (or three times if you count passing through it on the train). I'm glad it didn't get me, but if it had I wouldn't really have gotten any wetter. Even my Eee was wet so it's been retired for a few days until I'm really sure that it's properly dry and safe to turn on again.
