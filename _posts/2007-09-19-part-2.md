I'm rubbish at writing this so long after it happened. Thankfully the photos are handy visual cues that remind me what to write about next. I think at the end of the last bit I had just decided to go west (life is peaceful there!) toward Stanage Edge. The terrain changed several times, varying between the heather, grassy hummocks of wetness with reeds and moss, and high high bracken. The bracken was very abrasive, so whenever I walked through it I had to hold my hands on my head to stop it brushing against my arms painfully. I was only wearing a short sleeved shirt... this was a tricky choice, cos it's the only wicking tshirt I have, but it doesn't cover all my arms!!! I'll almost always take a bit of extra heat in order to avoid the elements burning / freezing / hurting me. A couple of sheep got freaked out when they realised that the creature moving towards them through the bracken wasn't another sheep but a tall freaky human. They alternated between running away, looking at me disapprovingly while eating, and maaaing. Occasionally they used combinations of the three. I encouraged them to run ahead of me and forge clearer paths. Nice sheep. 

Once I got through the bracken I was exhausted. I'd been walking through rough pathless terrain for over an hour and a half, so I decided to rest in a clearing. The ants in the area were spawning and having none of that, however. I sat down for about five minutes, constantly removing flying drones / queens from me, until I realised I was so busy picking up insects by their wings there was no way I could pull a book and some food out of my pack for a proper rest - so I headed on and climbed the ridge. Luckily, from far away I had judged correctly and it was a safe location to ascend without climbing equipment. Many areas on the ridge are popular with climbers and cannot be climbed or descended without sensible equipment and skills, neither of which I had. I'd wished, when far away from the ridge, that I'd had binoculars, so I could be sure I was heading to the correct spot... but I'd already wished for a compass and I knew if I took stuff for every eventuality I'd be horribly weighed down.

Once upon the ridge I rejoiced. Going was eaaaasy on nice smooth well walked paths. No chance of getting lost now, I just continued along the edge until I got to the same place I'd descended from the edge when I'd walked a section of it previously, coming from the other direction. There were lots of holes carved in the rock, with grooves running into them to direct the rain to pool into them. They were numbered, and if they started from zero there were at least fifteen from what I saw.

There was <a href="http://www.catwithnoname.com/photos/bamford2/images/12092007390.jpg">wool without a sheep</a> on the ridge. I assumed at first it was just a dead sheep, but there were no bones at all. Did a random hiker shear a sheep for some reason? we'll never know. 

I descended down <a href="http://www.catwithnoname.com/photos/bamford2/images/12092007396.jpg">The Long Causeway</a> which was large and impressive from below, like giants had kicked the ridge and made lots of chunks of rock fall off. I just looked up the word <a href="http://www.google.co.uk/search?source=ig&hl=en&q=define%3Acauseway&btnG=Google+Search&meta=">causeway</a>, and it doesn't seem to fit in these circumstances. I think causeways should involve moisture, and there was a <a href="http://www.catwithnoname.com/photos/bamford2/images/12092007400.jpg">tiny stream</a> to cross on the way down but that certainly didn't count, it was so small.

Once I was all the way down the edge but still heading downwards through the valley to Hathersage, I encountered <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jane_Eyre#Context">North Lees</a>.

<b> North Lees</b> <br />
<br /> The hall had Charlotte Bronte stay it it in the 1800s, and is believed to be the inspiration for <i>Jane Eyre</i>'s Thornfield Manor. 

I met a  <a href="http://www.catwithnoname.com/photos/bamford2/images/12092007404.jpg">slutty kitty</a> who wanted to be my friend and said "mraw" when I tried to stop stroking it in order to head home. I did anyway, willing it not to follow me onto the busies roads *l* 

I skipped going to Little John's grave, which my walk route told me to do, cos I live in Nottinghamshire so the Robin Hood thing is kinda old.... I then arrived in Hathersage, where I decided to go to a pub to have a coffee whilst awaiting my train. Silly me, only pub there had machine cappuccinos that tasted JUST LIKE PACKET MIX! The horror. I sipped about seven sips and decided to stop drinking it lest I die. I'd kinda had an ulterior motive when I went there anyway, cos they had cleanish toilets, so I used that and left the drink on the table 2/3 undrunk. 

That was prettymuch that day, apart from one nifty thing: <a href="http://www.rspb.org.uk/wildlife/birdguide/name/r/redgrouse/index.asp">Red Grouse</a> live in the area and I know I scared loads. I thought they might be Grouse, but writing about the walk reminded me of them, so I checked out the sound they made on RSPB and they definitely were grouse. The angry little dogbark chatter they make is distinctive. I love identifying animals and plants on my walks. I think I already know loads more than Darren cos he doesn't really care what things are. When I first came here I used to ask him what plants were and he'd just say "I dunno, a plant!". I soon stopped bothering *l*
