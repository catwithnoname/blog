<p>Next steps are a bloodtest (after 12hrs fasting) and another ecg. I sincerely doubt the ecg'll catch anything - they're frequent, the palpitations, when they come, but they're not always on, and can't dependently happen at any given time. When you consider that the ecg only lasts a few seconds... oh well.</p>
