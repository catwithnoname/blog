Shamelessly stole that phrase from Chains in <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/0575076941?ie=UTF8&tag=cat09-21&linkCode=as2&camp=1634&creative=19450&creativeASIN=0575076941">The Lies of Locke Lamora</a><img src="http://www.assoc-amazon.co.uk/e/ir?t=cat09-21&l=as2&o=2&a=0575076941" width="1" height="1" border="0" alt="" style="border:none !important; margin:0px !important;" /> (he used the word bum rather than brain, but it's the same general word genius). M255's exam is done with and brainfuckery is over for months, which causes me to say Woooohooo!!! 

I was quite disappointed with how the exam went. I've done a trillionquadrupillion practice questions from previous exams, and sat a mock exam locked up in a room by myself, and was confident I'd have enough time. I finished the mock exam 40 minutes early and got almost nothing wrong whatsoever. Yet when the real one came apparently real life stress got to me. I spent far to long, for example, debating what 9/4 was. the 2 bit was easy, but for some reason the .25 simply eluded me. The last question was horribly rushed, and the second to last question I had to leave and go back to just in time to write some quick nonsense like "//need to change this from .values() to .keySet() and re-write, but <span style="text-decoration:underline;border-bottom:1px solid #000;">NO TIME</span>" . Literally as I wrote that last E and underlined NO TIME, the invigilators told us to put our pens down :( I really really really really really really wanted to get a distinction on this course, but that question may have bollocksed it up. There was never any question of passing or nat, but merely passing just isn't what I want. I'm a good programmer, dammit - you don't skive for a month, study for a week here and there, and still get a combined average of 97.5 on all the assignments without having at least a slightly decent amount of understanding of the subject matter. It's frustrating that a big part of my mark is based on the hugely unrealistic scenario of having to produce perfect code hand written on paper with nary a syntax highlighter or chance to compile and test for only-takes-seconds-to-fix bugs. But it is so. 

Amusingly, Dad was telling me about a programming course he did in Uni (I'm the only person I can think of offhand who has a dad who probably knows more about computers than me...). Dad had to hand write code, hand it in to someone who would key it in and pass back reports of what had happened (I don't recall if it was printed out or on screen results) and then of course debug by hand and hand it in once more to be keyed into the computer. The process seems utterly hilarious looking at it from where I stand, and yet it must have actually been plain old painful. Certainly as dad said, it was slow. 

So, what to do now? Oh yes, let's go to Tesco to redeem clubcard vouchers into <a href="http://www.tesco.com/clubcard/deals/browse.aspx?N=4294966209+4294966286">clubcard vouchers value * 4 for the OU. </a> In Java terms that might be
double currentVouchers = 22.5;
int OUMultiplier = 4;
Tesco.sendOutVouchers(currentVouchers * OUMultiplier);

ok that's enough, thanks. My next class will be the October presentation<a href="http://www3.open.ac.uk/courses/bin/p12.dll?C01M257">M257</a>, possibly taking M256 semi-concurrently when it starts in January. They each end at different times, so I reckon I won't have too much study conflict for the exams (never mind the TMAs, which may conflict). I've never done two OU courses at once, but M255 had such low demands compared to the webapps course that hopefully M256 and M257 will be similarly simple and undemanding. And thanks to Tesco clubcard I'm saving Â£90 on one of those courses. I'm strangely conflicted in the way I feel about Tesco clubcard vouchers. "Every Little Helps" and <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/business/8009513.stm">highest ever record profits for any UK retailer</a> (including noticably upped shopping bills) don't seem to run together quite right. I try to shop at Tesco regularly because of the clubcard, and because they're local and open at convenient times I prettymuch have to shop there - no one else is open after martial arts class at night, which is a regular shopping time for D and I on Tues & Thurs. But sometimes I wonder if shopping at Aldi and putting a bit more savings away for the OU would simply be more sensible.
