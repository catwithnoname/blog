So, the last few days have been busy ones. I went to a uni tutorial in Lincoln (booked the day off and went with Darren) about a week ago, intending whilst in town to finally buy much needed running shoes to replace the miserable old ones I have. Looking back, <a href=2"http://catwithnoname.com/wordpress/?p=66">I've known I've needed new ones since 2007</a>, but I think it was the bits falling off the soles and the squeak from the left shoe that finally broke the camel's back. I went to 3 or 4 sports stores looking for decent trainers/sneakers (take your pic! Darren hassles me if I say sneakers but it is my preferred word.) only to learn that "sports stores" are actually fashion stores. There were no running shoes that weren't pink, and the sales people didn't know much about the shoes or whether they were of a decent quality for running and would support my foot. I don't care how much I need shoes, I refuse to submit to the tyranny of the "women want to wear pink" notion. There's nothing wrong at all with pink as a colour. I might actually like it. But it's ridiculous to make women's things only in pink, leaving me with a choice between a badly fitting man's item, or one tailored for my size and shape that comes in a single colour. Or to make a laptop,  mobile phone, or some other gadget, and to make it in silver, white, or black, and then the only other colour is pink - "for girls". 

This meant I completely gave up on shoes for the day, thinking perhaps to go to <a href="http://www.decathlon.co.uk/EN/">Decathlon</a> after work the next day. They are better than most of the sports stores out there, but they still seem to think that women's clothing doesn't work without pink... Before I got a chance to go there, however, John G at work recommended <a href="http://www.keep-on-running.co.uk/">Keep on running</a>, which was quite close to work. It was perfect. I walked in, told him I wanted shoes, he looked at my stance and my overwide feet and found me two pairs that fit and provided decent support, in human colours. I was really pleased. There weren't many pairs for widefoots like me, and my feet aren't big enough to try men's shoes either, but I still managed to come out owning a new pair of running shoes. When I buy "fashion" shoes I generally just go for shoes that are too long to compensate for my foot width, since I won't be wearing them to do anything important like walking. Not that I've bought any like that in the last couple of years... *lol* my last three shoe purchases have been running shoes, walking boots, and cycling shoes. The set of casual boots I wear most often at home I've had for about ten years, and they're awfully tatty. I can't wear my old knee high boots either, since they don't fit on calves since I started walking regularly. I'm not very proud of the shabby shoes, but how can you justify paying lots of money when you hardly ever get to wear casual clothes because of work anyway? And how can you avoid women-who-love-to-shop when shopping for shoes? Such quandaries. I'm almost as scared of womens' clothing and shoe stores as I am of chatty hairdressers.

Suunday all day coding for an assignment, (monday shoes), tuesday evening was all martial arts then sleep, and all day wednesday I was coding again. I produced completely working code, but last moment realised I'd made some of the code too complex. Since the deadline was Thursday at 12 midnight, I figured that if I could manage to dredge the energy out from somewhere, I could do it either before or after martial arts class. I didn't manage to squeeze it in before, and when I got back from class, Darren's parents car, which we have been looking after until his dad was a bit healtheir (his mum doesn't drive) had been broken into. Nothing was stolen - not the stereo nor the coins that live in there for parking. Poor Darren had reported it to the police and cleaned it up on his own while I was at class, so all I had to do was drive it round to his parents' house when I got back. They have a gate in their backyard to let the car in and lock it in, whilst we don't, so it was a bit more secure. Then we had to walk back home, and ended up eating greasy kebab whilst walking home. So.... no fixing errors on code. I've never really procrastinated as badly as that before, and I don't intend to again. It will disappointing to miss out on marks I didn't need to. 

Beside all that, I've been feeling like a huge bitch about work, but I can't really post piles of bitching about it on the world wide interwebs....
