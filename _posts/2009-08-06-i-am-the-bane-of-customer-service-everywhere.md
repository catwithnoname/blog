My debit card was declined for graze.com the other day. Moment of panic and terror, then remember to log on to online banking. There's still money there; no terrible money destroying catastrophes have occurred. Better. Calm, breathing, no longer feeling ill. 

I've had my cards deactivated twice before when my normal activities looked like possibly a fraudster had gotten my card (you'd think that by now this "irregular" behaviour would look regular...). Figuring this had happened again,  I called NatWest during lunch. They assured me that my card was fine, and it was Graze's fault. I say "but it's worked fine for months, and I didn't change a thing". She says they've still had an admin error somewhere. Ok, I accept this and attempt to reregister the card with Graze. It still says no. Grrrr. I resolve to ask D if I can use his card (same account) to register when I get home in the evening. 

When I get home, I check the post, and there's a letter from NatWest's fraud department saying my card has been deactivated because of some unusual activity...

Grrrr. I've called them and sorted it now. Frustrating that the fraud prevention has burned me three times. Better safe than sorry, and all that, but I've never been a victim of fraud. Fraud protection has only caused me grief so far :( 

I daren't do more than mention the very difficult process of cancelling an unused three mobile broadband dongle. The lady on the phone could SEE I hadn't used it in months and still presumably had to try and convince me to go for a different plan. I got very sick of repeating myself. "I don't want to buy anything. I just want to cancel my account".
