Just outside Consett, I really enjoyed cycling through a nifty snakey area that I could see was popular with all sorts of cyclists. Cyclists with more balls than me (in a figurative sense, cos most cyclists have more balls than me in a literal sense) were going up and down the hilly bits, but I just followed the meandering path. It's the <a href="http://maps.google.com/maps?q=http://trail.motionbased.com/trail/kml/episode.kml?episodePkValues=6913074">Jolly Drovers Maze</a>. <a href="http://www.sustrans.org.uk/default.asp?sID=1095252379453">Sustrans has some pictures</a> and a <a href="http://www.sustrans.org.uk/default.asp?sID=1121269805734">description</a> of it.

I can't stop sneezing, just took another antihistamine. I hate my hayfever.... I really need to get another doctor appointment to see if they'll give me some more of the lovely steroids that fixed me for a few weeks earlier this year. I can sometimes tell what time it is because I'm sneezing again, and I know when the sneezes are due, based on when I last took an antihistamine...  I hate arranging doctor's appointments though. It's in Worksop, which is inconvenient when I work in Sheffield, and apparently they won't be doing evening appointments for much longer. Unless I'm genuinely really really sick, I refuse to miss work for a doctor appointment.... and if I'm really really really sick I might need to go to A&E anyway. Bah. The worlds needs to be more 24/7. I'm happy to work crazy hours as long as I can still see my sweetie, but too much of the rest of the world just ain't....

On a good note, the antibiotics seem to have made my armpit cyst shrink to almost nothing and stop being painful.
