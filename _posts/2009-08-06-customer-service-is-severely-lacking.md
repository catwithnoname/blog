Darren registered with GoDaddy.com yesterday for a web hosting package, and we spent most of the day setting stuff up. Once of the things we needed was Secure Shell access (just another way to access and command the server, also known as SSH), and we'd rejected any hosting package that couldn't offer secure shell automatically. 

So once we decided on GoDaddy and got it all registered and paid for, we followed the instructions on <a href="http://help.godaddy.com/article/4942">this article</a> to attempt to enable it. Basically, input your phone number, and they should call you in about 10 minutes to enable SSH. 

Input number. Wait. 50 minutes later....
Input a different number. Wait... after 20 minutes, email GoDaddy:

<blockquote>
Hi,

I've attempted to enable SSH tonight with two different telephone numbers over a period of at least an hour, and I still haven't received a phone call. Is there an alternate way to register?

Regards,
</blockquote>

The webform said we should get a response within two hours. Darren got an email within two hours promising a response in 24 hours. Sheesh, the 10 minutes gets longer and longer! 

This morning, Darren got another email:

<blockquote>
Dear Darren Linacre,

Thank you for contacting Online Support.  
Here's the lowdown: To SSH to your Linux Shared Hosting account, you need to enable SSH within the Hosting Control Center. SSH can be enabled on paid hosting accounts only.

SSH is a secure method of connecting to your hosting account to upload files, move files, and execute commands. When you enable SSH, it is enabled for the primary FTP user associated to the account.

NOTE: If you have databases on your account, you cannot setup SSH. We recommend backing up your database structure and data before deleting it and enabling SSH. After SSH is enabled, your databases must be recreated. See Backing Up a MySQL Database for more information.

To Enable SSH on Your Linux Shared Hosting Account


1.	Log in to your Account Manager.

2.	In the My Products section, select Hosting.

3.	Next to the hosting account you want to modify, click Manage Account.

4.	In the Settings section of the Hosting Control Center, click the SSH icon.

5.	Type your Country Code, Phone Number, and Extension (if applicable) in the corresponding fields and click Enable.
NOTE: SSH requires a strong password. If prompted to change your password, click Change Password, type a new password, and click OK.


6.	We call the phone number provided within 10 minutes. Once the connection is established, an automated message plays a message containing a PIN. Type the PIN number into the You will be called with your PIN field and click Verify.


Once verified, it may take 24-72 hours for SSH to be enabled for your account. See Using SSH to Connect to Your Linux Shared Hosting Account for information on how to connect to your account using SSH.

TIP:If you did not receive the call, or have entered the wrong pin, repeat the steps above to receive a new call and a different pin.


Please also note that If you do not complete this process while still on the SSH setup page, or navigate away to another page before completing the verfication process, you will have to start over.

If there is anything else that we may assist you with, please feel free to contact us via email or for a speedy response, you may call our support line at (480) 505-8877.  We are available 24/7 for your convenience.


Sincerely,

Now, compare that email to the <a href="http://help.godaddy.com/article/4942">article we'd been following</a> to get SSH enabled. Mighty familiar, isn't it? It's a real shame that GoDaddy's people can't read a two sentence email properly. At least their copy/paste skills are strong. 

Darren tried it again this morning and got a call straight away, so it may be that our account wasn't set up properly yet when we were trying to enable SSH at first. But we've already learned that GoDaddy's customer service is lacking. I hope the webhosting service is better than the customer service. 

If you're curious, it's pretty empty, but D's online lair is <a href="http://falkonsforge.com/">falkonsforge.com</a>.
