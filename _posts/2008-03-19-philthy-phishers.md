Got a paypal "phishing" email into my inbox today, looked REALLY genuine. It's soooooooooooo easy to be pulled in by it, too. When I saw the "Critical Information Regarding Your Account" from "Paypal" I rushed to check the mail, and very nearly clicked on the link inside. 

"Dear user

Due to the safety and integrity of the PayPal
account you have been notified with this message.

As a security measure your PayPal account information needs to be
updated in order to reduce the instance of unauthorized transactions on our website.
If you could please take 2 to 3 minutes out of your precious time and confirm your details you will not experience
further problems with the online service.

Once you have updated your account records your PayPal
services will not be interrupted and will get protected with additional security.

To protect your PayPal account start with the following link:
Click Here To Continue"

I've reported it to Paypal and to Googlemail (when I did the latter it automatically popped into the spam folder that I never check). It's scary how close I came to surrendering my detail without thinking, though. And how many people will have been fooled by it completely and lost money? Ouch. Paypal points out that they always use your name, not "dear user" like my mail was addressed. I'm terrified my mother-in-law might get fooled by a phishing mail and then vow never to touch the internet again, despite it being a Most Wonderful Tool. When you follow through to the spoof site it looks completely genuine too - although I suppose it's worth noting that clicking on the "Verisign identity protection" logo doesn't lead you to the Verisign site... unsurprisingly.....

I need to go wash my hands now, or something. Evil phishing bastards.
