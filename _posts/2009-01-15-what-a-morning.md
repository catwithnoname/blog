It's 12:08, I'm finally off on my lunch break at work.... 

Earlier today I had an engineer call our team up for advice (this is not our team's function) and ask to speak to one of the guys on the team. Yeah, cool, I'm just the blonde reception chick I guess.... Dick.

And a couple of hours later a customer called up and proceeded to yell at me for the "fucking piss poor" service we provide. 

I hope the afternoon is nicer.
