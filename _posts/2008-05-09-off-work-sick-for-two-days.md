Sore throats suck, but realistically, I could have gone to work probably if I didn't work at a callcentre. I just couldn't face talking all day with an already sore throat. I'll be back in tomorrow, but thankfully it should be a shorter day so less talking. Strepsils help a lot, too. The doc says it's nothing serious though and should be gone in a few days. Apparently it's going about. It's been quite strange lying about in bed all day. I didn't even get dressed on Thursday at all, just frolicked about with a sheet on at most. Cos it's WARM!!!!!!!!! Luxury.
