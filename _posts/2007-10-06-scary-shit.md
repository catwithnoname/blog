My ebay account was hacked within the last 3-4 hours. Bids were made and cancelled and detected by ebay and my account was locked. I've got to go through all my financial accounts and change my passwords now. I'm inquiring if they knew how it was hacked - they emailed me about it, after all - so I can protect myself more efficiently. The dude who "I" tried to buy an item from said he hadn't listed it either, so I wonder if ebay itself was hacked rather than my account. It's scary. I'm not really thinking straight. I've been using the internet for nigh on a decade and never had anything like this.
