I SORNed my vehicle today. I was going to pay the tax again cos I think I'll be driving in a month or two, but I need to be insured as well and that's too much work.  That is one Good Responsible Thing.

The second is I passed my most recent course and it only took 2 months to get the results this time.

You have achieved the highest course result status possible because a distinction is a pass grade 1. If you want more information about grades of pass you can consult the Course Results section of your Assessment Handbook.</blockquote>
