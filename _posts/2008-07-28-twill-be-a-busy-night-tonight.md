Darren's Aunt's laptop is still coming back to haunt me, so I'm going to go over there to find out what's going on. There's a 90% liklihood that this one is a <a href="http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=picnic&defid=2416731">PICNIC</a> error, and possibly some damaged equipment as well. The other day when Lolo & Judith and I were killing time in Edwinstowe waiting for our bus, she was texting me and telling me that her internet connection wasn't working. I got her to unplug all the cables from the router (based on the fault description she'd given me), unfortunately to no avail. When I asked her direct questions she was saying things like "I've tried everything I can think of"... which really doesn't answer my question, because I don't know what she's thought of! I eventually got quite annoyed and stopped texting her since she wouldn't answer my questions sensibly... which is really unlike me, I think. Texting is just so cumbersome and slow, and I really would rather have paid attention to friends than ... work... and I wasn't going to call her on the phone with friends about. 

When we spoke to Darren's mum a day or three ago we found out that some of the cabling she'd been using had been munched on by <a href="http://www.catwithnoname.com/photos/lucy/">Lucy</a>. Nice of her to volunteer this info! I'd never realised I should ask her if her dog had been eating her equipment. Stupid me.... 

Apparently that cable's now been replaced, thankfully. She rang up yesterday saying that Norton Internet Security Suite was demanding her attention. I asked if she could just ignore it, but apparently not... Darren talked her through uninstalling it. I'm quite peeved that it was on the system at all - I'd installed ZoneAlarm, and been quite careful (or so I thought) to uninstall every trace of Norton before installing zonealarm. From experience, it can be a HUGE pain in the butt to remove if you install another firewall before removing it completely. 

Darren then tried to talk her through connecting to the internet... apparently she was talking about BT Voyager all the time, which is realllly confusing - because her router is Netgear or Linksys, if I recall correctly. Is she trying to connect through two modems plugged into each other? A neighbour's wireless network? Who knows....?

So today after work I must make a pilgrimage to her house to suss out what the hey-tang is goin' on. Hopefully it won't be more than an hour each way to cycle there.... I don't mind the ride (I'm looking forward to it really) but the weather is... ominous... and I would like to do other things like eating and seeing my spouse tonight.....
