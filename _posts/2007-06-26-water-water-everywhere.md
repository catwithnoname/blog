that's a quote from something, I think. But what? *checks* It's <a href="http://etext.virginia.edu/stc/Coleridge/poems/Rime_Ancient_Mariner.html">The Rime of the Ancient Mariner</a> (that's not a typo btw).

Yesterday it was raining hard when I got up, and had been for some time. On the train on the way in I joked with Matt that there might not be trains back but I was not really worried because a couple of weeks ago the same thing had happened and I had no problems.

I got to work wetter than I ever recall getting on the way to work. My feet felt like they were constantly immersed in a swimming pool inside my sneakers. When I took off my sneakers and socks, my socks were quite sopping and I managed to wring a lot of water out.  I normally take a change of top and trousers, and bike in casual clothing. I keep spare dry socks in my desk for emergencies (such as this one). I wished I'd had underwear as well, cos that was wet too. My spare clothing was inside a plastic bag because last time it was badly rainy, when I put the clothing on I found it was wet. This time, it still was. I guess I hadn't folded the plastic bag over properly.

So, apparently I was talking about ze weather. It rained honestly ALL day, and not just rain but <strong>Rain</strong>. About midday I got worried about the trains being cancelled and checked on nationalrail.co.uk. Magnificent tool. It told me all trains had been suspended for the day. Shit. I texted Matt (lots) and he got his mum to come pick him up. He got home at 20:30ish I think. I got special permission from my (wonderful) team leader Chris to get off 30 minutes early so I could get a ride with John, who also live in Worksop. Many roads were diverted due to extreme flooding or flood danger. It took us an hour or so to get about 3 miles. Only about two hours in total though, so it wasn't too bad - we could have been stranded in our cars like many others were. We can see meadowhall quite clearly from where we work, and that was one of the bad places.

Darren's mum was alone in the house 'cos his dad was in hospital for a scheduled procedure (an angioplasty, which didn't take place due to staff shortages, presumably because they couldn't get in, were busy with flood emergencies, or both.). She got a knock on her door and was told that the river near her (normally it's a stream with a grand title, today it qualified for the name river) house had burst its banks and her house was going to be flooded. She could see it coming up so unplugged as much electrical stuff as she could and took it upstairs, then came down to stay with us for the night. Boy were where glad that we had tidied the house on Saturday since Matt was coming about *L*. I went to Tesco to get supplies (we had little food, and I got british things like bacon which she didn't eat anyway *L*) while Darren went to his mum's house to walk with her.

I got back after they did and was greeted by the very amusing sight of  Our Cat vs The Westie Beth. The cat held her own, calm and pretty relaxed (she did hiss and swipe a couple of time though), and the dog was waaaaay stressed out by this wicked catty behaviour. We ended up separating them just cos the cat seemed to be enjoying it. I personally think our kitty was just keeping an eye on this crazy white dog creature that had invaded her house but Darren theorised the she was bating Beth.

Sleep occurred, and I got up at 6 just in case there was going to be a train, but the trainstationlady said No. So I rang work and game the verdict to the nightshift people, then rang in again at about 0800 when there was a team leader in to officially tell him. We then decided to walk back to the inlaws house. we were greeted by these: <a href="http://www.catwithnoname.com/photos/flood">Worksop Flood Pics</a> we had to go a roundabout way to the house and instead of it being a 15-20 minute walk it took three quarters of an hour. I don't mind, I like walking. I did get wet feet though. When we got to the house it was ok. I think you can figure out which pics were the back yard though. The car on the left in the blue is ours, if anyone cares - it's a ford fiesta, which is living there til I can drive legally. I offered to move both the cars for them in case the flood levels rose and it got the cars (the flooded car in the pics is from a different house) but darren's mum though it would be ok and said they were both insured (they aren't Or at least mine isn't *L*). In retrospect their car is an automatic so I would have struggled, I think *l* all I know is the don't have clutches, so I guess it's something like turn on the car and take it from park to drive, and just forget the clutch stuff, or something silly like that..... I would definitely feel like something was missing I think even if I got it to go. 
Afterwards we got back home and I finished my Gurgeh book. I like it and am dying to learn more about the Culture now.
