Ok, here's the longer version, 

Thursday before last, I was at home using up the last of my holiday days before the new year. About 3 pm I got a call from Darren who was accompanying his father in the ambulance. I ran down to the hospital to find a resuscitated man who was not exactly healthy, but he was breathing. 

Apparently he'd been having breathing problems and had called the docotor for advice, who'd then called paramedics to their house to check on him. During the checks he'd coughed up some thick phlegm which had blocked his airway so completely he couldn't clear it or breathe, so he turned blue, passed out and started having a fit. Darren's mum did chest compressions on him, and between her actions and the paramedics' actions he was brought back to conciousness - somewhere along the way the phlegm had cleared. 

He was in Accident & Emergency for just under four hours - the NHS (National Health Service) targets state that they need to get everyone out of A&E within that time period but we were pretty darn close. He was moved to a ward and when we left he was sitting in the bedside chair, since it was easier for him to breathe when he was upright. His chest and ribs were in pain from the chest compressions.

He spent three days in that chair. On Friday when we visited he was a very very unhappy and unwell person. He could feel phlegm he wanted to cough up, but he was too scared too, and his chest hurt too much to do it properly. He could only take shallow breaths because of the chest pain, and his feet were swollen, much like they had been when he'd had heart failure a couple of years ago. We were afraid it might be happening again, but a doctor checked him out and said his heart seemed to be ok.  

Saturday, we visited and were heartened - he seemed to be a lot healthier and happier. But Sunday we didn't attend during normal visiting hours as planned - we had to rush in because he'd been taken to the Coronary Care Unit. We spent most of the day there, but by the end of the day he was looking alright again. He knows the nurses in CCU from previous hospital visits, so he was a lot happier being on CCU than the other ward. When we left he'd had the news that he'd have to wear a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Positive_airway_pressure">CPAP</a> mask overnight to make sure he was getting enough oxygen. He was a bit grumpy about that - he calls it a Darth Vader mask, and he really hates it. Grumpy is good though - when he's really bad he can't even manage grumpy, so all in all we left feeling positive(ish). 

Monday I headed off to work as normal - but on my bike partway to the train station (at about 6:25) Darren's mum called me - he'd had another cardiac arrest. So zoom zoom to the hospital once more, sorry work, I'm not in today! We spent all morning there, but left in the afternoon for some lunch and a nap. Back at 2 o'clock when normal visiting hours are - only to be ushered in to a side room. 

The next few hours were some of the worst of my life, I think. And I've had some really shitty hours. He'd been fine one moment, even taken the mask off a bit, but subsequently had another cardiac arrest. He was still lying there unconcious being resuscitated as we spoke. We were told that it was unlikely they'd be able to get him back this time. Darren, his mum, and I sat weeping in the side room for a time, before another nurse came in to say that we could come and stand by him - if we wanted. There were still six or seven medical staff around him at all times... 

Seemingly miraculously, however, he was transferred to Intensive Care and put on a ventillator. We were left for several hours in a relatives' waiting room just off the ward.  When we were finally let in - at 7 or 8 pm, perhaps later (time really blurs around these events). He was sedated so that the ventillator could work properly. We still had no optimism or hope left in us at all, so there was a lot of crying, holding hands, and goodbyes said. 

Monday, tuesday, wednesday passed, with the sedation slowly being lowered. He slowly started to come around, and he doesn't appear to have suffered cognitively from the oxygen deprivation. Now the big question was - will he be able to breathe without the ventillator? They switched it to a mode where he had to draw breath himself but the tube was still present - and he could breathe. Yesterday, when we got there in the morning, the ventillator was out, and he just had an oxygen mask. In the evening, he had a bit of a voice, albeit still hoarse. He even ate for the first time (vanilla icecream, dude), although he did still have the feeding tube in his nose. 

At home, keeping the mundane bits of life going has been almost too much on its own. The cat's been kept fed, the house somewhat tidy, the dishes done, and we've even eaten some cooked meals (and a lot of ready-made crap besides). We've had a bit of humour - Darren's mum stayed at our house for a few nights, and little white westie dog vs cat is an interesting experience. They'd been friendly enough to leave unsupervised the last few days, so it wasn't ever a serious problem - mostly there were just funny scuffles - like the cat stealing the dog's beanbag and not letting her back on, or the dog trying to eat that cat's food or vice versa. 

The last week and a half has been such an emotional rollercoaster, with everything looking up one moment, and down the next. We've been scared to get our hopes up at the signs of improvement in the last two or three days, in case something bad happens again. But I think we've started to feel a bit more positive anyway.
