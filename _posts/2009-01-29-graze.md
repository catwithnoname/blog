I just got my first <a href="http://www.graze.com">graze</a> box through the post, delivered to work. It's fresh and dried fruit and nuts for the super lazy, delivered when and where you want. Each box costs £2.99. Whilst you might think "pffff, I could buy lots and lots of fruit for that much money"! I argue that since I <em>don't</em> buy fruit on my own, a bit more money is worth it if it makes me eat some of that darn "5 a day". 

Today I got fresh grapes (yummy), pineapple raisins (are they grapes? or pineapple? I'm not sure, but they're also yummy) and a mix of brazil nuts and dried banana / papaya bits. The dried fruit was stiiinky, literally and figuratively, so I fed it to Henry. (My team leader...). I've already chosen not to get any of the stinkyfruit again.

If anyone wants to try a box (if you're in the uk... do I know anyone like that?) you can get the first one for £1 if you use the code "1DMVMLZ" at <a href="http://www.graze.com">graze.com</a>. (And it'll also give me a pound off my next box! Bwahahaha)
