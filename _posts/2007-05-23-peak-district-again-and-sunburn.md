Peak district again (and sunburn).

Curbar Edge / Froggatt Edge walk, starting and ending at Grindleford.

Started by getting the train to Sheffield, then discovering I had about 1.5 hours to wait for the train to Grindleford. The wait was solved by a tuna bagguette and a cappuccino. (It was over Â£5 for the two... robbery at the trainstation cafe, I say! I had about 10p too little change and had to run back to an ATM to get another Â£10 out.) Otherland tided me over for the rest of the wait and all the way on the train to grindleford (which is only a few minutes really, it's the second stop).

I was using my Collins Rambler's Guide to the Peak District as my map and direction-thingy. It told me to start at a carpark way up on the peak, but I couldn't do that cos I'm not a driver (yet). so I started it from the trainstation halfway along their route, which is circular anyway, so starting wherever is fine. Actually finding the entrance to the path was tricky as I didn't know which side of the road to enter it, but some locals gave me directions cos they're nice like that.

From the very start it was a beautiful idyllic woodland track. The sort of sunny blue day you have to be really lucky to happen to pick (in england, at least *L*). Also the sort of day that gives you sunburn even with three applications of sunscreen. I've decided to buy a hat now. I want a cowboy one like Michaela got in NZ, but I don't think she'll part with hers. I think she should though... *lol*. Anything non-girly should do, as long as it provides back-of-the-neck shade as well.

I continued to walk through villages and woodland, and crossed over a bridge where a group of walkers were congregating. One of them pointed to a flag flying off a nearby rooftop and asked if I knew where it was. It was a weird moment where I actually knew more about something culture-ey related than people around me (being a foreigner in prettymuch every country you live in does this to you... ). It was Aussie flag *l*. He then asked me what the stars meant.... and again I knew! It was the Southern Cross, a constellation that can be seen from Australia (or from NZ, but with less stars, hence why the NZ flag is the same but with fewer stars).

I then hurried on to where I was heading because the group was milling about and well... I was walking on my own and stuff like that. At this point I was walking along the banks of the River Derwent, through a wetland/woodland place that had lots of conservation stuff going on. The signs were quite interesting, talking about brook lampreys, voles, plantlife, newts, mice so small they can climb single stalks of grass (I think they were called harvest mice), and other stuff I recall not.

There was also a couple in the wet area who were hugging a tree for some reason. I'd seen them at it, and then when I went past them, the guy told me "we're hugging trees" and walked on. I don't know why they were doing it *l*. I nearly tried myself just to see if there was something up the tree they were looking at, but I didn't want to be seen copying them cos they were weird enough on their own without a random stranger's help *l*

When I got to a road I was a bit unsure of whether to follow the track further or turn off on the road.... the group managed to catch up with me again, the sneakies, and gave me some directions. I ended up walking with them for a while and found out they were from Worksop, of all places. You travel for an hour and a half to go walking far away only to find you're actually still at home... *l*

I split off from these guys again to head up, and up, and up, towards the carpark that signified that start/end of the official route.... it went up for a long time in the sun. I was hoping that at the car park there might be a refreshment / icecream van to help me cool down (Last week when we went walking, I had three layers on and was nearly too chilly. This week I had three layers on and was melting in the heat.) On the way up I saw this, which was amusing:

You can see the endlessly-going-up-road on the left... I continued up, and then up some more, and eventually got to the car park. There was a duck sitting there up at the top all on its own nibbling grass. Don't normally see lonely waterless ducks, but there it was. There was also a pretty cool old-looking <a href="http://catwithnoname.com/photos/20070523/images/23052007022.jpg">convertable</a> parked there. I read the info signs about the area and then continued on icecreamless... maybe it wasn't the right season for the icecream van yet.

As I was just stating on the new path leading out from the carpark, a guy stopped me and told me he'd just seen a snake. Now, to go back to those signs I just mentioned... one of them was talking about Adders, apparently Britain's only poisonous snake, which lived in the area. It said scary things like Do Not Touch and Call 999 If Bitten. It also had a black and green picture of one. So of course I asked the guy to describe it, and he said... black and green. Yippee *l*. I didn't actually see it, but kept my eyes open so I'd not step on it or anything, and warned some more people approaching the area that a snake was operating in the location.

About this time my body informed me quite determinedly that it needed more fuel or it would not go any further.I had some tuna and some nut / dried fruit trail mix and about 20-30 minutes later my body told me it was okay to go again. I'd not realised just how much that uphill walk took out of me.

Along the ridge I picked up some wool that had rubbed off a sheep on some treebark and made a thread-thingy with it, but considering I couldn't card it and had no spindle it's well... a bit flimsy *l* nonethesless... sheep's wool is strong! and rough and scratchy! long live cotton.

I continued along the ridge of the peak I'd climbed for quite some time, and eventually I descended, turning left and making it all the way back to grindleford again. The last interesting thing I saw (whilst hurrying to make the train I found time to take a picture of it. I decided it would be ok to potentially miss the train cos it was just so cute.) was this mouse:

It was just sitting there on the pavement, alive and aware but not scared or anything. It was very very cute.
I still managed to make the train despite the rodent distraction, and headed home and dyed my sweetie's hair all blonde and cute. He's just had his hair cut and combining those two with his goatee makes a very yummy but newish figure. Mmmm. *g*

And that is all.
