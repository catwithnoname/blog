Good <a href="http://trail.motionbased.com/trail/activity/6841300">bike ride</a> today. I took the train to sheffield and biked home on portions of <a href="http://www.sustrans.org.uk/default.asp?sID=1099574956906">cycle route 67</a> and <a href="http://www.sustrans.org.uk/default.asp?sID=1215165045875">route 6</a>. It took a lot longer than expected, for two reasons. One was a bizarre wormhole that kept on making me come out in the same place time after time (well, only twice really). I think it might have had something to do with signs having been stolen, cos who needs route markers anyway? The second thing that slowed me down was completely missing an important turnoff, and having to double back on myself. I only had my sheffield city cycling map with me, and no other maps, so getting lost in any area that wasn't sheffield wouldn't have been a good idea. Thankfully I got myself unlost before I was too lost to do so. My ride ended up being quite a few miles more than expected though - I'd intended to go easy today since it's not long til my C2C ride. Yaaaaaaaaaaay!

I discovered that <a href="http://www.rothervalleycountrypark.co.uk/">Rother Valley Country Park</a> is utterly awesome. There's waterskiing! And boaty things! it's only about an hour away by cycle too so maybe I can convince Darren to go there sometime soon? Hmmm. He may expect less demanding transportation.
