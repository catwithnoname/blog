.... by lolo, and I now I have to tell 8 things you didn't know.

Soooooo....... (pssst... I can do &lt;ol&gt; right first time!)

<ol>

<li>I worked at a hospital for a year and a half, doing a job that involved admin and surrounded old people. I hate hospitals (I feel dirty and likely to get infected somehow) and I don't feel comfortable around old people.</li>

<li>I have a chicken pox scar under my left boob.</li>

<li>Sweets / candy that is hard outside but has a bursty out liquid centre is just Wrong.</li>

<li>I actually enjoy my job and will come home smiling some days</li>

<li>I can't remember the date of my wedding anniversary very well. I think it might be the 29th of March.</li>

<li>I'm a fat person at heart. I could eat and eat and eat and eat and eat and eat and... Food!</li>

<li>I have a filling I got when I was about 13. I'm a bit ashamed of it.</li>

<li>I haven't done situps regularly in weeks.</li>

I think that's 8 but lolo's tagged too many people so my tagline will have to end here.

</ol>
