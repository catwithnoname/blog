These are a couple of comics that are true repositories of teh awesome. 
<ul>
<li><a href="http://theoatmeal.com/">The Oatmeal</a> releases amusing one page comics, including important reference charts such as <a href="http://apostrophe.me/">How to use an apostrophe</a>, <a href="http://theoatmeal.com/comics/computers">Why it's better to pretend you don't know anything about computers</a>, and <a href="http://theoatmeal.com/comics/zombie_how"> how everything goes to hell in a zombie apolcalypse</a>. </li>

<li>The second (strip featured above) is <a href="http://xkcd.com/">XKCD</a>. It's actually witty and intelligent, with few cheap gags. The author makes fun of <a href="http://xkcd.com/241/"> Ender's Game</a>, <a href="http://xkcd.com/606/">Portal</a>, and many other wonders.</li>
</ul>

On a completely unrelated note, I'm going to change my webhost in a couple of months. It's silly to avoid blogging because you don't want to cope with the slow server...
