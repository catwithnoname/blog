We got a <a href="http://www.argos.co.uk/static/Product/partNumber/8701129.htm">kitty scratcher</a>. She likes to stand on the tube at the bottom and poke up through the hole in the middle to play with the dangley toy. She's been in the house and on top of it too. She scratched it! She climbs the posts! A success!!

Believe it or not we have 47 pictures of her trying it out *l* I was going to post the highlights but it's taking years to upload. Oooof.

I went to the local health centre place thingy so the nurse could stick a needle in my bottom and make it all stiff and evil. Yay depo! She checked my blood pressure and said it was quite good, not that I recall what it was anymore. I suppose it was particularly good considering I had bikes there in a rush cos I was running late. Or would that make it low? huh. 

This proved that my headaches were not a blood pressure problem. She suggested that I get my eyes tested. I decided to hit the streets and see if I could get a same day appointment. There are about 7 glasses places in worksop, but nooooooo same day appointments. Bastards. I don't want to book one on a wednesday sometime in the future and lose another walking day so I'll have to put up with headaches for ages until I decide I can survive a week without walking or biking.

You know that minty hot feeling you get when you use a strong toothpaste? Darren says it is a cold feeling, which it kinda is, but more hot in my brain. Imagine how that feels when you brush your teeth, then imagine that sensation in other parts of the body, and consider avoiding Durex play tingle.

Star wars music makes me feel patriotic. I watch those words scrolling up the screen, and my heart swells. I need to watch all of the films in chronological order now. It's all cos we've been playing <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/B0007A5FZS?ie=UTF8&tag=cat09-21&linkCode=as2&camp=1634&creative=6738&creativeASIN=B0007A5FZS">Star Wars: Empire At War</a><img src="http://www.assoc-amazon.co.uk/e/ir?t=cat09-21&l=as2&o=2&a=B0007A5FZS" width="1" height="1" border="0" alt="" style="border:none !important; margin:0px !important;" /> and the expansion, <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/B000J0X7Q0?ie=UTF8&tag=cat09-21&linkCode=as2&camp=1634&creative=6738&creativeASIN=B000J0X7Q0">Star Wars: Empire at War Forces of Corruption</a><img src="http://www.assoc-amazon.co.uk/e/ir?t=cat09-21&l=as2&o=2&a=B000J0X7Q0" width="1" height="1" border="0" alt="" style="border:none !important; margin:0px !important;" />. I'm seeing Kessel and thinking spice mines and a smuggling run done in less than six parsecs, seeing Bothawui and thinking "many Bothans have died to obtains these plans" (that's Mon Mothma, probably a misquote), seeing Kuat and thinking shipyards. It's all so exciting!!!! No more movies to come. *sad*
