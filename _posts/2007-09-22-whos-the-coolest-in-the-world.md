The same person who normally is, of course - Darren! When I got home last night from working late, apart from the wicked Haagen Dazs which he'd placed in the freezer, there was a blue zip up folder on my desk. Now in the US I recalled seeing loads of ring binder folders covered in cloth and zippable - they look really good for carrying uni work in my bag when I go to work, cos I can hold pens and loose paper in there and even thin books. They don't seem to be very common in the UK though, and even when I search staples.com (as opposed to staples.co.uk) I couldn't see any. I'm sure I saw these folders in staples when I was there, but no luck... well, not much. I did find some on amazon.co.uk advertised as art folders, but I never got around to purchasing one. 

Apparently the Euronics (some sort of small business electronics supplier) rep had given one to his boss who had given it to darren. It still has the <a href="http://www.euronics.co.uk/">Euronics</a> logo, but that's ok. And it doesn't have rings, but those weren't really essential anyway... so I have a folder! yay!

There are leather folders like the ones I described above, reasonably common. I don't like leather though, it makes me feel like I should regard everyone around me as peons and dictate things for my PA to type. 

Naturally I unzipped the folder... and inside was an Ordinance Survey map of Worksop and surrounding areas! This means I can go biking to sherwood forest or... anywhere...! Darren knows what makes me happy so well *g*
