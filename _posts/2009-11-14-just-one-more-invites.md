I seem to have a plethora of invites for services one might need, if one was a geek, I suppose.

<a href="https://wave.google.com/">Google wave</a>: Everyone wants invites, then get in to google wave and say "ok, now what?" It's funny. But you know you're not cool if you don't try google wave, right?

<a href="http://www.jolicloud.com/">Jolicloud</a>: Are you into netbooks? This is an interesting little OS and works better (so far) than Eeebuntu NBR did on my Eee701. (The rumour mill says <a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2009/11/13/google-chrome-os-to-launch-within-a-week/">Chrome OS</a> is coming soon. Eeep!) 

<a href="http://brizzly.com/">Brizzly</a>: A twitter and facebook web client. Better than twitter because it shows inline pictures and expands shortened URLs. The auto-refresh is a bit dodgy, however. Unblocked at my work currently, although who knows for how long?

Anyone interested, let me know your email address and I'll send an invite or three. Random strangers are allowed to apply.
