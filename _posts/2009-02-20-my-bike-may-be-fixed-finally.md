I dropped my bike off at <a href="http://www.jejamescycles.co.uk/">J E James</a>, on wednesday, which is the same place I bought it about 6 months ago. I was led to believe that it would be fixed the same day, so I hung about in sheffield, and did some awful shopping for clothes (because on tuesday, at work, a pair of trousers had split in a bad place. Lucky I had emergency trousers!) and I had some more coffee, and bought <a href="http://www.ageofconan.com">Conan</a>, and had more coffee.... I went to the <a href="http://www.spinsheffield.com/tours/Winter_Garden/2">Winter garden</a> and got shat on by a bird..... after nearly dying of boredom and still no contact, I rung J E James, only to be told it'd be tomorrow after all. A frustrating day, all in all.

Yesterday, thinking my bike would be ready, I jogged into work so I'd not have the problem of 2 bikes at work, and only one me to ride them home. But nooooooo phone call came until I was on my way home, with aching legs, having jogged most of the way to the train station before stopping and whimpering a bit. Randomly upping and jogging seven miles is owwie, I've learned. Even with nice running shoes. I suppose it wouldn't be so bad if I trained running a bit more, but well... hiking and biking are more fun. Running is boring. (Don't get me wrong though - if I have the right shoes and I'm walking anyway, I'd rather run). I have blisters too, but I didn't notice them until I actually <em>looked</em> at my feet. I guess I've subjected my legs to so much over the last couple of years that a few paltry blisters are beneath my normal notice. 

Talking of subject my feet to badness, I turned my little toe purple the other day! It got caught in the gap between two mats at martial arts on tuesday, was sore but normal looking, turned purple wednesday, and was mostly better by thursday - visually, at least. Physically it's still pretty painful, but not enough that I think it's likely to be broken. And even if it was broken AFAIK there's no point going to the hospital since all they'll say is to rest it and it might hurt a bit until it heals. 

Back from the random tangent... I managed to finally pick my bike up at lunchtime today. <a href="http://www.fapfap.co.uk/">Stewart</a> from work was going into town on his own errand right near J E James... so we went in together, did our errands, and got KFC. The boneless banquet isn't too bad, but is scarily lacking in any greens. Do bbq beans as a side count as a veggie? (<a href="http://www.5aday.nhs.uk/WhatCounts/PortionSizes.aspx">The NHS 5-a-day</a> pages suggests that they can count as one portion. (Heh! I win, sweetness!)) In any case at least burgers like to pretend you have salad by throwing a couple of shreds of lettuce and a bit of tomato in... 

Hmm, I re-tangented. I bet that's not a word, but I enjoy intentionally using silly nonexistent words, as long as I'm aware I'm being silly, and as long as others are too. I'd hate for people to think I genuinely spoke english as a second language, with my crazay name and funny accent. Eugh. 

See? I can't stay on topic. Does it matter? Naaaaaahhhhh.... I'll not try my health-serviced bike until tomorrow, just leave it in a cupboard at work. That way I can get the big bike I rode in to work today home on the train. The 20:49 train I'll be getting shortly is just about guaranteed to be empty, and the train I'll be taking home from work tomorrow is very likely to be nearly full. Logistics are clear, but blaaarrrgh to the fact that I have to jog in again tomorrow.

Hometime now. Be good my kittens.
