The week we spent in York must be one of the most amazing weeks I've ever spent. Who knew grubbing in the dirt could be so goshdarn nifty? 

Anyway, just a few quick links:

<a href="http://www.dighungate.com/">Dig Hungate</a> - this is where we were. 

(This post is really difficult cos the cat is on my mousepad and I might get in trouble if I don't keep scritching. Who thought that you could use a mousepad to catch a cat rather than rest a mouse?)

<a href="http://picasaweb.google.co.uk/yochannah/HungateOurPhotos">Photos</a> - of us digging, and of interesting stuff in general. I need to do some installationey magic to get my nice flash galleries back, so at the moment I'm just using Picasa cos it's really easy.

I intend to do a day-by-day account of how the week went, along with a lot of rambled excited ruminations.These will be forthcoming, probably tomorrow at work since it's a bank holiday and there'll be nowt to do....
