I dream about Eees. I still have none. People all over the UK seem to be having trouble even with good retailers. I placed my order with play.com a week or two ago, when they SAID in stock...... My course started a week and a half ago, I was sure at I'd have an Eee by then. BAH. I ordered my mouse on extrafast delivery thinking I'd need it soon. I could have done free delivery if I'd known *lol* It is a looooovely wee mouse though, complete with a sturdy looking carry case. It's all lonely  on my desk without an Eee to accompany it. 

And did I ever mention we got a Panasonic 37" plasma TV? Darren had it hooked up to his PC like a second monitor yesterday.  It's loooovely because it's HD ready, meaning you can actually read text on it. We used the opera browser on our Wii a bit on our old CRT TV, but the resolution of the TV was so rubbish text was unreadable. That's not the case now - it should effectively be a third way of accessing the internet, not that there are almost ever three people at our house who want to do different things on the internet at the same time.
