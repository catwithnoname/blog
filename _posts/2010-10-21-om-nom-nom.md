<a href="http://www.bbcgoodfood.com/recipes/408642/coconut-noodle-and-vegetable-soup">Coconut, noodle, and vegetable soup</a> last night was delicious. There's something about thai style cooking that suits me really well - possibly the strong flavours like chilli, coriander, lemongrass, coconut... 
I had to modify the recipe a bit - 1) because the fish sauce ain't too vegetarian - I just omitted it - and 2) there were no beanspouts at tesco! There were mixed stir-fry veggie packs with em in, but I didn't want the mix, and don't like beansprouts much anyway. Saying that, I used sugarsnap peas in the soup and they were edible despite my sincere dislike of peas. I added more mushrooms and noodles (I used thin rice noodles rather than thick ones, too) to make up for the lack of beansprouts. I even went back for second helpings, because it was just too good. I don't even like soup much but thought I'd cater to D and his mum who like soup and peas and sprouts... 

Aside note: if you get emailed by formask.com, please don't try to sign in or reset the password for the site. I'm pretty sure that it's a phishing scam trying to get a password from you that you might use on other sites, if you're silly enough to do that! Please don't, it's so dangerous. There are <a href="http://lifehacker.com/184773/geek-to-live--choose-and-remember-great-passwords">so many good ways</a> not to have to have passwords that are insecure.
