We got the catnip spray and put some in her house. Of course she sniffed about a lot and curled up inside. After her experiences with the stoning cupboard, catnip must be like methadone to her *lol*. 

We had our TV on, on some sort of "Welcome to Sky, new viewers!" Channel that repeated the same few ads about "features" of Sky over and over. One of them involved a police siren going WeeeeeeOoooow Weeeeeooooow... and she got really freaked out! her ears were flat back against her head *lol* we laughed at her for a minute and forgot about it, but left the channel on. Because of the circular nature of the channel, it came on a couple of minutes later, and she freaked out (totally!) again! She must know she's a naughty kitten and the police are coming to get her! We decided to stop being cruel and turned the TV off.... but it was so funny!
