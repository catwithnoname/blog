In lieu of going to ireland last week or having visitors *sad face* we had a lazy week last week. We planned to go camping for the first half of the week, starting the first day by driving to the campsite and stopping to geocache along the way. Between the weather and the early time it got dark, we didn't get to do much caching though. <a hrewf="http://www.geocaching.com/seek/cache_details.aspx?guid=06bc407a-ca9e-4c65-a040-fda33c9f6017">The first cache</a> was near <a href="http://www.chatsworth.org/">Chatsworth</a>, and wasn't terribly fun since it was just a microcache - a film container with a roll of paper in it to sign. We managed to find it by going alllll the wrong way and getting lots of blackberry scratches and nettle stings - and once we found it we realised that if we'd gone along that nice little path no crazy climbing would have needed to happen. 

<a href="http://www.geocaching.com/seek/cache_details.aspx?guid=baecc80a-84cc-411d-bf5a-937cd2a8d7bf">The second</a> was a lot more fun - it involved a longer walk across boggy moorland. Tromping along through heather, peat, and thick moss always makes me happy. I took a nail brush from the cache and left a glowstick. I've been wanting a nailbrush for ages, primarily FOR peaty treks where it's almost impossible to get the peat out from under your nails. I really detest dirty nails. Even when I know I've gotten them as clean as possible and it's just a stain from the dark dirt it still seems to yell "poor personal hygiene!!" every time I see it. 

After the second cache we decided to hurry on se we'd not have to pitch the tent in the dark. Didn't work - we arrived at the campsite in near dark anyway, so by the time we started to put the tent up, it was fully dark. The campsite was in the beautiful village of <a href="http://www.betws-y-coed.co.uk/">Betws - y - Coed</a>, which had a lovely river running through it with some dramatic (and loud) falls. I think that 95% of the properties in the area were either camping stores, B&Bs, or cafes. 

The tent was great the first night, and we woke up happy and dry. It rained so hard and long that at one point, Darren woke me up, worried we'd be flooded out in the middle of the night. I conviced him we'd be fine, and that if it did flood nothing would be ruined anyway - and we were fine. I really didn't want to have to go back and fetch the car and move everything when I had been nice and warm and asleep. 

We'd wanted to walk up Snowden, weather permitting, but we took so long to get up in the morning that I decided it wouldn't be safe - I didn't want to get stranded on an unfamiliar mountain in the dark if we took a long time. We settled for an easier lake walk route suggested by the guide book we'd purchased, but once we started on it we realised that it was going to be a pretty boring walk-with-your-grandparents-in-the-park type of walk, so we pulled out the maps, modified it a bit, and ended up going through some amazing ruined stone houses. (I'll try to upload photos tonight!!).

That night when we slept the tent leaked, but not too badly. We had rain dripping on our heads as we slept, and a lot of the inner section of the tent was waterlogged. Definitely time for a new tent - this one has been in use for over ten years apparently, so I guess old age has made the seams less watertight.

The journey back was very tiring. It snowed quite a lot through Wales and England - at a couple of points I was very close to pulling over, not feeling safe driving in the snow, when it stopped snowing. 

I managed to make it home in time for martial arts class, but only just. Class has been cancelled loads of times recently because there aren't enought people attending to cover the cost of the room, and I'd hate to be the reason for it being cancelled. Grading's coming up soon. I have no idea if I'm good enough or not - I reckon I'm pretty shit, but then again, white belts are supposed to be pretty shit! I also don't know if I'll be able to get a day off for it, which could be rubbish. Sensei doesn't want to tell us when it is, but it WILL be on a day I work, almost certainly. And getting a day off work around christmastime? it'll be nigh on impossible. I could wind up missing grading and having to wait another whole year. If I wasn't likely to pass anyway, it doesn't bother me too much. But if I would have passed? That's poop!!
