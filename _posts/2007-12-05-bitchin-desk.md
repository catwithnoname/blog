Last week, about two days after I ordered my new desk I had a delivery and a missed delivery on the same day. The delivery was my noticeboard, which I'll be putting on the wall which was previously blocked by the shelves on my old desk. It's been left with the neighbours - I figured that the missed delivery was probably my desk, which wouldn't have been nice to leave with neighbours really. I called the delivery company and rearranged the delivery for today since that was the next day they'd be off and theydidn't deliver on weekends. Last night I dismantled my desk and even vacuumed under the vacated desk (note this is a rarity. the vacuum is usually operated by my sweetie.) 

This morning, all exited like, I went for my driving lesson, hoping that my desk might be here when I got back. Sure enough, the delivery had been made while I was away. Darren passed it to me. It was a bubble-wrap envelope containing some pins for my noticeboard. D'oh. Apparently the desk hasn't been dispatched yet. I have two questions. 1) why hasn't it been dispatched yet? and 2) why the hell make two deliveries for a noticeboard and pins? the pins would have fit through the doorslot anyway, so I have no idea why one got left with the neighbours and the other didn't. 

I called the furniture company to enquire about my desk, and they sent a query to transport about it for me. Won't even have an ETA 'til tomorrow, so BAH. And what am I doing now? typing on the floor with my monitor sitting on top of my PC tower. I'm just begging for more RSI problems, aren't I? but my desk is all re-mantled (I don't think that's a word, but it SHOULD be. It's a logical opposite of dismantled!) upstairs and it was plenty of bother so I'm not bringing it down again!!

An aside: My spellcheck wanted me to say neighbors but dang I won't!

And on a foody note, I just had a pleasant curryish dish. I can still smell it. mmmm.
