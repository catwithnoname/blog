Cos my walking makes me tired. I started off in New Mills, which I've been to once before, on my badly lost journey. When I was there I decided it had potential, there's a giant artificial (I think, could be the river's worn it down) valleys with rivers running through, the Goyt and the... Sett, I think. Looking down from above you are astounded at the height. Looking up from below is no different. It's like a haven of beauty in the midst of a town. My camera did no justice to the photos I got. It just doesn't seem to have the ability to record / perceive the depth the way the human eye does. Probably the best one is this image of a bridge:

To the left of the path, under the arch, you can see a street light. The arch is easily 2-3 times as high as it is. 
Finding the Sett Valley Trail was easy. It's quite cool that everyone in the town uses it, because it's a convenient path through the town. At the same time, it's a beautiful woodland path. I wish I had many beautiful woodland paths in Worksop. Heehee. 

The Sett Valley Trail used to be a railway, so it's very flat, straight, and easy to follow. While most of the time there is town to one side or the other, it's tranquil and you'd almost not notice. There are squirrels. I observed an incredibly cute one digging in the lead mold. When it ran away, I went over to see if it had a secret cache of nuts. It didn't, even when I dug in further wit ha stick. Maybe it was digging the hole FOR nuts, and I was helping....? *G*

I noticed a tree with lots of things hanging off it. It looked like maybe a birch with female and male bits, but I don't really know enough to say that with any authority.

Along the trail there were many bunnies, and a jay. Interestingly, when I tried to text Darren about the bunnies my phone decided it couldn't spell it, but it would say "cunnies" instead. My phone doesn't normally know naughty words. *L*

Once I got the the end of the trail in Hayfield I continued through the village for a short while, encountering an <a href="http://www.catwithnoname.com/photos/gal/images/10102007545.jpg">equestrian crossing</a>, (I was too lazy to fix the orientation) which I've heard of but never seen before. The light even had a person+horse instead of the normal green/red man. There was a cute cat, sorta <a href="http://www.catwithnoname.com/photos/gal/images/10102007544.jpg">Siamese</a> coloured with blue eyes. It let me take a photo of it, which was nice of it. I jokingly teased the kitten about seeing it, and she starting arching her back and hissing, which I found quite funny. AFAIK cats don't speak English but darn she seemed jealous!
The town was lovely - I'm really disappointed there's no train directly to there. I'd sacrifice the Sett Valley Trail to have it back as a train track again! *l*. It was clearly made before cars were a consideration, as the roads were very narrow, often not really wide enough for cars, and most of the didn't have a footpath. The stone houses were all either old or build in the same style, to look old but perhaps have better room size and structural integrity *l*. Pubs welcomed ramblers, dogs, and muddy boots. 

I left the town shortly. I followed along the banks of a peat-tinted river, past a campsite and many remote houses. There were a few ducks in the river, which I don't normally see - they seem to eschew the rivers coming off the moors normally. A magpie was sitting in the water too, cos it was raised by ducks perhaps. After the campsite I was overjoyed to see PUBLIC TOILETS!!!!!! Normally I'd rather die than go to a public toilet, but these were so seldom frequented they managed to stay relatively clean. They didn't have any working electrical lighting, only a skylight, but how picky can you get? I didn't have to bare my bum to the moors at all, never knowing when a stranger might wander up, and niftier yet, there was toiletpaper!!!! 

When I went a bit further I saw the niftiest roadsign I've seen in a while:

I've seen old people crossings, deer crossing, sheep crossing, but frogs? *lol*

There was a <a href="http://www.catwithnoname.com/photos/gal/images/10102007554.jpg">Sheep-plant</a> on the route. The wool is formed first, as you can clearly see in the picture. If you come  back in a few weeks, there'll be a lamb embryo hanging off that tree. In a month or two a fully formed sheep will just pop straight off the tree.

Or maybe it was just a handy place to scratch, and some wool clung on. I've been watching too much <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jayce_and_the_Wheeled_Warriors">Jayce and the Wheeled Warriors</a> (this lead Darren and I into watching trailers for this, he-man, thundercats, conan the adventurer, and prince valiant. Ahhhhh 80s cartoons! Such nostalgia!)

I descended up onto Kinder at this point, which is a biiiiiiiiiiiiig high peat covered plateau. Until  then the going had been easy, along placid flat valleys. I had to go through some footpaths on farmers' fields before I reached the proper moors and access land, (where I'm free to roam and don't have to stick to the path). The most amusing one had to be ths sign, with a cow on the left of the stile and a calf on the right: 

 <br /><br /> <img src="http://www.catwithnoname.com/photos/gal/images/10102007555.jpg" height="338" width="450"/> <br /> <br />

It reads "Caution: Caws with calves can be aggressive". Luckily I didn't seem to be a threat to them, and passed through without event. I did notice that cows shit an amazing lot, and while they're walking sometimes, leaving long liquid trails. Orange flies liked living on it, but they always flew away when I approached so I couldn't photograph them for potential identification later on. 

The path on the moors proper was bleaky stunning, if such a term is allowed, heather and grasses, moss and damp, fungi and peat. I stopped for lunch on a likely spot, and ate it while listening to grouse cakking in the valley. They really do sound like angry little dogs sometimes *l*. One would get disturbed and make noise, and others would respond and it would take ages for them to settle. When I got back up and walked on I noticed three nearby. I climbed up, snapped a couple of bad photos, and rang Darren. They didn't seem to care I was there and making noise. I was feeling quite wicked, and I chased one so that Darren could hear their cakk cakk cakk noise *l*. I felt really really privileged to see them so close up. 

The top of the moor, not long before my subsequent descent, was marked by Edale Cross. I couldn't decipher the writing on it. . It's a medieval protected cross - the <a href="http://www.nationaltrust.org.uk/main/w-vh/w-visits/w-findaplace/w-highpeakestate/w-highpeakestate-countryside/w-east_midlands-places-peakdistrict-map-jacobsladder.htm">National Trust</a> says:

<blockquote>The summit of the route is guarded by Edale Cross, an ancient monument once marking the boundary of the land given to the Abbey of Basingwerke near Holywell, Flintshire, in 1157. It is also known as Champion Cross and stands near the point where the three old Forest wards of Champayne, Hopedale and Longdendale met.</blockquote>

I rushed down Jacob's Ladder, which is a stony ex-packhorse route, and ran about half the time for the next 1.5 hours in order to make an earlier train. At the train station, a walker complemented my hat, said I'd gone far (another complement!!) and then proceeded to show me photos from previous walks he's been on. He even burst into song once, for long enough that I felt I should sing along or something, but as I'd never heard the song I couldn't really do that, so I just smiled and mentioned I didn't know it. He surprised my by pulling out the sheet music and lyrics for it, and I found out it was a song he's written about a walk he'd done in Scotland. I was very strongly reminded of tall dark rangerly types in fantasy books, singing about places they'd been around a campfire for young unworldly travellers. This guy was a modern style ranger of course, because no rangers in fantasy books wear shorts and have Scottish flags popping out the back of their backpack. I still feel strangely honoured by the encounter. I wish I'd caught his name - it was on the music! But it was time to get on the train, so I didn't see him again. 

now, I'm sore and tired. *sleeps*
