These are the photos so far: <a href="http://picasaweb.google.co.uk/yochannah/Killarney#">Killarney</a> and <a href="http://picasaweb.google.co.uk/yochannah/BantryArea#">anywhere that's not Killarney</a>.  If I'm unlazy enough, I may even blog about it too. I had planned to this evening, but was overtaken by another one of my sneeze/cough/wheeze/phlegm fits that I was whining about a blogpost or two back. I hate this time of year for making me so miserably sneezy, and yet being the only time of year I'm ever warm enough.
