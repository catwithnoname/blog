I haven't been walking enough lately. I'm really looking forward to having my exam over and done with on the 15th (along with the bit of me that's dreading it coming up as well). So I managed a shortish walk on Wednesday - I basically looked for some paths I'd not been on before, fully knowing that I'll have to go over well known areas as well. I know the area near to all the train stops too well - I'll have to start taking buses or find a new area to go to if I want to keep on walking in new and exciting places.

The route I took from Edale train station took me over some farmers' fields along the bottom of the valley (this is the short route to the place Shaun and Ulrica and D and I stayed many longtimes ago, which we didn't take, favouring the <a href="http://catwithnoname.com/wordpress/?p=278">orc house</a> route instead).  There were many moo-moos, maa-maas, neigh-neighs, and poing-poings. The moo-moos had calves, that I'd have liked to photograph a bit closer, but since I was in the same field with them I figured it'd not be a good idea to go between the mamas and the calves...

Later on, I passed through another field in which the cows decided randomly to go for a few short sprints. Being in a field with large running bovids is rather intimidating, to say the least. It was quite amusing to see a black horse gather itself and chase one of the cows, too. They were roughly the same height and length, but the heavyset cow was galloping along, udder swinging, as though something big and scary was coming for it, rather than a very slim horse.

I left the path rather abruptly towards the north up Jagger's Clough. I'd misremembered a previous route incorrectly and thought I'd been up this clough before, but I certainly would have remembered it if I had! (Clough: steep valley/gorge in the side of the mountain, carved out by water. Note this is my definition rather than tinterwebs/dictionary in general.) Up until the clough I'd been on easy, well trekked pathways. The clough was far less walked and the path wasn't always clear or evident - but this didn't matter too much, since the relentless upwards climb of the clough walls showed you the right way clearly enough.

The clough was far more beautiful than I could have ever imagined, and extremely tranquil. I didn't see a single person on it, despite stopping and relaxing on some bilberry bushes and reading for half an hour.  There was so much unexpected beauty along the way that I could barely walk for stopping and taking photos. I crossed the stream to photograph a small wasp nest, but was forced to retreat when they decided to come out and approach my hand (eek!!).

The only large life forms I did see were a couple of sheep who were somewhat offended that I intruded upon their haven. The mama crossed over the river as soon as I came near her, but her silly lamb stood looking helplessly for a few minutes on my side of the stream. As with the cows I really would rather have not gone between the mama and the little one, so I stood far away and ridiculed it until it finally did cross over and out of my way. They photograph well together, don't they?

At times there was nothing to do but walk directly up the streambed, so I'm glad I wasn't doing this on a rainy or icy day. The top afforded vistas of a heather covered plateau and surprisingly dry peat. I'd worn my gaiters thinking I was going to get soggy boggy black peat stains all over my legs, which are hard to clean off once they're dried. Instead, I found myself sweating extra around my lower legs for no reason. Fire warnings! I was horrified to see <a href="http://picasaweb.google.com/lh/photo/EZLEAWtSuA6jBhroIrNX8A?feat=directlink">this</a>!!

The top of Kinder plateau and the descent went all to fast, and soon enough I was back down to Edale and waiting for the next train back to Sheffield. Bah.
