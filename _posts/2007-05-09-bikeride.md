Bikeriding is good. I really need one with bigger wheels and less foldyness though. I'm always talking about bikes I think. Anyway, I went on a nice long bike ride down the canal here, and then past some lambs I'd discovered existed a  few weeks back on a driving lesson. There were three main things of note. One is this:

Just what were they slaying, I ask?

The second was my Mandarin duck. I saw it again and took many pictures but it had been diving so looked a bit ragged. It was also very rainy and the camera's not great. This eventually sums up to "<a href="http://catwithnoname.com/photos/index.php?level=album&amp;id=4">low quality pics</a>". The fisherman I was standing beside whole photographing the duck told me that a Mallard duckling had thought the bait on his hook was ducklingfood and gotten himself hooked. He got it off and checked it over though. He did report that the mamaduck wasn't too sure about him handling her ducks.

The third thing is that lambs are cute. This one even appears to have posed for the camera *l*
