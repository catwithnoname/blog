I've been tagged by <a href="http://pseudo-element.thegeekcartel.com/blog/">lolo</a> to post the 6th photo of my most recent photo album. This appears to be photo number 6 from Paris, of a very cute boy:

It's while we're waiting outside the entrance to the catacombs. I'm not sure if I posted my main album link: <a href="http://picasaweb.google.co.uk/yochannah/Paree#">Paree photos</a>. I tag <a href="http://ulimonster.livejournal.com/">Ulrica</a>, since I think she's the most likely to have some photos handy *g* (of a <a href="http://donncha-mikael.blogspot.com/">cute young man</a>, or possibly some green baked good...?) I'm supposed to tag six people but I don't have the energy...
