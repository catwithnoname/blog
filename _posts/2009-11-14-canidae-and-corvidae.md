I saw a fox! :)

It was dead. :(

I think it was killed by a motorist - it was lying plain as day on the red psycopath, stuck in the fold of a small newspaper with its legs, tail, and head sticking out. 

A few minutes later, I was parking my bike and listening to a magpie. The magpie would say "kek-kek-kek" as magpies do. It was all on its own in the car park, in terms of magpie company. Near it were 20 or 30 crows (there are always many crows at work. They try to spook you I think). The crows responded to the kek-kek-kek with a raucous group "caw caw caw". As long as the magpie stayed silent, the crows stayed silent. But it seemed it could not resist kekking, and every time it kekked, the murder of crows cawed. 

I've never seen (heard) anything like it. Weird bird convos.
