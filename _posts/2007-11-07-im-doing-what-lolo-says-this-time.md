Bah to blobligation. I really need to study so the rest will just have to wait. 

But for lolo: <a href="http://www.catwithnoname.com/photos/scotland1/"> Gallery 1</a>,  <a href="http://www.catwithnoname.com/photos/scotland2/"> Gallery 2</a> and  <a href="http://www.catwithnoname.com/photos/scotland3/"> Gallery 3</a>. 

But you will have to wait for a different post to find out why Shaun and I are trying to fly in a couple of the pictures and what all those pics of plain old rocks really are...
