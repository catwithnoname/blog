I worked. It was a bank holiday, when banks should all really be closed. I was expecting a day of ease and reading. It was, except for four hours of it. We had a call for a server come through.... obviously all calls for servers impact a lot more people than a single PC would, so there's a short SLA time. Normally, I have very little to do with server calls. The server support team "vets" the call - putting on any instructions for the engineer, or any parts, if needed, and the allocation team finds the appropriate engineer for the area and assigns him to the call.

Server support doesn't work on a weekend, and the OOH team weren't answering, so I had to do it myself. that wasn't really a problem because it was only a reboot, no parts needed or anything.

Allocation for this location doesn't work on the weekend either. We have to do that too. I pulled up the rota, assigned it to an engineer, but this ended getting escalated to a higher-up, and we made about 7 phonecalls to each other trying to sort it out. I must have called 6 or 7 engineers trying to find the right one through what felt like a pile of incorrect engineer rotas. I left about 10 or 15 voicemails I bet. it was a royal mess of engineers, team leaders, other team leaders, and bigger up bosses. Then an engineer called and left a message with the other colleague on the desk to day that he would do the call (only two of our 15ish person team work on weekends / bank hols) but my colleague didn't take his name down, and as I said, I'd called about 7 engineers, so we had a problem cos all we knew was that AN engineer was attending but not which. It eventually got sorted out but was a pain in the butt.

The evening was fine at home, until Darren's mum called up to say his dad had fallen over. The backing story to this is that he'd been in hospital last week, following another heart attack, and while he's okay heart wise now, being in the bed for five days has done something to his legs and he can barely walk. He's been using crutches to mobilise in the house and sometimes sleeping downstairs. Yesterday morning he fell and hurt his arm, and then in the evening he tried to put his weight on the arm on the crutch and fell again (I think). We raced down there on the bikes, and he was up by then, but they both looked utterly exhausted, so eventually Darren and I took their spare bed down from the attic bedroom and set it up in their front room, which is pretty much unused, on the bottom floor, so they could sleep properly (and not on the couch as they'd previously planned). I think social services and / or the Occupational therapy / falls team is getting involved tomorrow. I also wonder if we should suggest to them that getting a bungalow, everything all on the ground floor, would be a good idea. I don't think it's likely, cos they've lived there prettymuch all their adult life, but it doesn't hurt to suggest.

The weirdest thing is that despite having an emotionally exhausting day, it wasn't a horrible day, in reflection.

I think the cat's left a present in the litterbox, I can smell something icky.

I'm uploading our Israel photos finally, now I've got the LAN with Darren's PC back. for some reason his IP had changed to 192.168.1.4 instead of 192.168.1.2. See the photos page.
