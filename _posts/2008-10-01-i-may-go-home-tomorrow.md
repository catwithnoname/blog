This features among the more shitty things that could happen on this bike ride. I'm not injured, dead, mugged, or attacked... I suppose I should be more grateful? Narp. Yesterday my folding bike got a puncture. it's the second time in a week, which was annoying but not really a problem, considering that I was going to take my big bike anyway. So... tires on the big bike are at correct pressure, all oiled, ready to go! The train rides were relatively uneventful, until the last one - it kept on breaking down. there was something wrong with the door, I think, and it was nearly an hour late by the time i reached my destination of St Bees I didn't mind if it was late, really, as long as it wasn't so late I'd have to cycle from St Bees to Egremont in the dark. I did have lights, so even if it had been dark it'd not have been a tragedy... 

My bike not going when I got to St Bees was a bit more of a tragedy. I looked at it, poked about, and tried t cycle again... only for the doodad that changed the gears on the rear wheel to completely fall off. Ohhhh yeah. Great start. Luckily I'd had the foresight to purchase a chain splitter tool. I removed the offending snapped device.... there was no way to repair it, the cast metal had snapped, probably crappy quality steel. Using the chain splitter i shortened the chain so my bike would function as a single speed.... so I got to egremont and to my hostel eventually, getting off to walk the steep bits since i couldn't exactly change to an easy gear...

the place i'm staying at is a chhheaaaapppp hostel... Â£8 a night.... and i'm the only one here!! it's really weird. empty and sterile. what's even weirder and more annoying is that the nearby church's bells have been ringing for over an hour. Annoying, and i hope it stops soon....  I'll need to sleep?

So tomorrow I'll go hunt  a cycle store. if i can't get it fixed by about midday, I'll have to abandon the rest of the journey, cos my timing will be off. I'll then forfeit my deposits on my hotels and have to buy another ticket back to worksop..... i REALLY hope I can get the stupid thing fixed!!!

that's all for tonight.....
