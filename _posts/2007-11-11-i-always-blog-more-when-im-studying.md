All this HTML 4.0 in my CF book is making my skin itch. This book was printed out in good ol' Y2K, and is outta date. It doesn't even mention CSS, and has no excuse - the W3c specs 89********* (notice the kitty contribution there) for css1 existed in 1996. It's one BIG thing that annoys me about the OU courses I've done before - it's all out of date. I'm not sure in all cases how ColdFusion likes XHTML, because I'm not being taught it, and I really should be. 7 years old in real years is a lot  longer in computer years. Sure, it'd only take me a couple of hours to get up to speed  with how CF meshes with XHTML rather than HTML, but wouldn't it be a whole lot better to teach me what's up to date straight away? I don't really want to work with table-based design, unclosed &lt;li&gt; or &lt;td&gt; tags, deprecated attributes like bgcolor, and capitalised HTML tags. 

Oh, if I can ever be bothered I might make a category / tag thing or three. "Web Development", "Walks", and "Just Stuff" would prettymuch cover my blogposts I think.
