Spent the bank hol weekend in london with a friend who moved down there recently for a new job.... I had a half dayoff on friday so we could get the cat down to the cattery and stuff, and we had a really easy train journey down. I'd been looking forward to it all week because I could use my Eee on the free Wifi on the train, but typically the server was playing up and so I could connect to the train's local server page but not the big whole internet. 

Matt's place was a studio flat so we had to sleep on the floor / camp mattress in his combined living room/bedroom. The bed wasn't big enough for two, so I got the bed the first night, and darren got the floor. It was incredibly strange to share a bedroom with someone else. There was silly talking and reminiscence of old "camping trips" in the backyard that darren and matt had done as boys, and just general chatting and joking after we'd put the lights out. I kept on half-expecting to hear a parent's voice through the door telling us to go to sleep because we had school the next day. It really, really reminded me of childhood sleepovers. (I use the term "sleepover" here, but I didn't use that word when I was small I don't think. It sounds quite American to me, but I can't think of any other term. My multi-national life makes my English really screwy sometimes.) Strange, because talking late at night while lying in bed with my spouse is completely different. I think we got to sleep at about 130 am, which isn't really that late, I suppose.

We had a good time on Saturday, wandering town and purchasing a couple of pars of jeans for Darren, with Mexican for lunch and Thai for a very late tea (we left the restaurant at about 11PM). It wasn't so late to sleep that night, but at 3 am we were woken by my poor poor sweetest, who had just vomited on the bed - I'd taken the floor this time, which was probably good, because cream carpet + vomit would probably have been hard to clean. Matt ran out to get a bowl in case there was more, and it was good he did, cos it got filled to the brim. Byebye Mexican lunch and Thai tea. The interesting thing - it actually smelled good, presumably because of the aromatic foods that had gone into it! I know this is probably TMI, but ah well. After the cleanup Darren went to sleep on the floor beside me since the bed wasn't really suitable. I got back to sleep with little trouble, but Darren and Matt had more difficulty - Darren puked again apparently while I slept, in a more appropriate place this time, and Matt went for a 4 am walk to try and clear his head. 

The next day, Sunday, was spent in lazy lethargy - Darren was too ill to do anything and it was pleasantly warm for the first time in living memory. (Well, almost). Amazing how quickly people in the UK shed layers when they think it's hot. I was still wearing two layers and was quite happy that way. I'm almost never too hot in the UK *sad face*. Darren's got a rash all over his torso that he's gotten almost every time he's been sick recently. We've noticed before that he seems to get sick often when we go out to visit people / have guests, but this time was kinda the last straw. It's happened too many times to possibly be just really bad luck. After a bit of thinking my best guess is that it's likely something we do, or something we eat, that happens when guests are about but not so much when we don't have friends to share it with. Like perhaps eating out. The only common factor I can think of is Mexican style food , although it might be something else. Now I just need to see if I can get him to the doctor, or BUPA, for allergy testing.  

Today we left London about midday. Poor Darren's barely eaten anything and has been feeling awful all day. I forgot to use my Eee on the train today, even though the Wifi was working. I was just absorbed in <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/0099518473?ie=UTF8&tag=cat09-21&linkCode=as2&camp=1634&creative=6738&creativeASIN=0099518473">Brave New World</a><img src="http://www.assoc-amazon.co.uk/e/ir?t=cat09-21&l=as2&o=2&a=0099518473" width="1" height="1" border="0" alt="" style="border:none !important; margin:0px !important;" />. It's a very, very interesting book. Not really interesting at all plot wise, but an astounding glance into an unreal projected world. The word "dystopia" seems to be often used in conjunction with this book. It reminded me in some ways of <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/0140232923?ie=UTF8&tag=cat09-21&linkCode=as2&camp=1634&creative=6738&creativeASIN=0140232923">Snow Crash</a><img src="http://www.assoc-amazon.co.uk/e/ir?t=cat09-21&l=as2&o=2&a=0140232923" width="1" height="1" border="0" alt="" style="border:none !important; margin:0px !important;" />, and <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/0140232923?ie=UTF8&tag=cat09-21&linkCode=as2&camp=1634&creative=6738&creativeASIN=0140232923">Snow Crash</a><img src="http://www.assoc-amazon.co.uk/e/ir?t=cat09-21&l=as2&o=2&a=0140232923" width="1" height="1" border="0" alt="" style="border:none !important; margin:0px !important;" />, and <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/0722185170?ie=UTF8&tag=cat09-21&linkCode=as2&camp=1634&creative=6738&creativeASIN=0722185170">The Amtrak Wars</a><img src="http://www.assoc-amazon.co.uk/e/ir?t=cat09-21&l=as2&o=2&a=0722185170" width="1" height="1" border="0" alt="" style="border:none !important; margin:0px !important;" />, where government and corporation / company are synonymous. The seemingly absurd take on capitalism that also isn't too unreal, perhaps. It makes you think of embryos starved of oxygen and nutrients, to make them pliable and happy to do menial work using their sub-human intelligence. Children are relentlessly conditioned to think what the government wants them to think.  

I'm not finished saying what I think about the book but I need to go to bed now. Ta-ta.
