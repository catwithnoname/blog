Ok. Started out nice and early, left home just after Darren. I'd prepared my backpack mostly the night before, so all I had to do before I left home was sort the catfood and catlitter out. 9:15 AM train to sheffield, 10:15 train to Hathersage. On my way at 10:30 or 10:40, with a lovely coffee safely inside me, bought at sheffield between trains. I started off on the wrong foot, as I couldn't find where the trail started. (I know now I should have gone to the right of the post office, not the left.) I ended up taking a roughly two mile detour - I realised where I was after not long, but it wasn't where I wanted to be. I didn't want to backtrack, cos that would suck. to I headed forward until there was a place I could turn right and hook back up with the trail without really missing out. It added about two miles onto my journey, but that was ok.

On the way I learned that while some sheep are born and grow up to be sheep from lambhood, <a href="http://www.catwithnoname.com/photos/bamford1/images/12092007303.jpg">some sprout fully grown from the bottom of trees</a>.

That sheep was too lazy to even bother standing up properly to eat. Its back legs are standing and its front legs are sitting. 

I encountered some sweet blackberries of the gods on the way, and also some sour blackberries of the devil. I tried to eat only those that looked like they had lots of sunshine to ripen nicely, but it didn't always work. I'm quite curious how <a href="http://www.catwithnoname.com/photos/bamford1/images/12092007316.jpg">this snail</a> managed to get amidst the berries. It's thorny! I soon got back on track, where I encountered <a href="http://www.catwithnoname.com/photos/bamford1/images/12092007319.jpg">a barrel of water with looooads of swimmy bugs in it</a>. I wonder what sort, might wiki it if I have time. 

I even saw some raspberries!

 I'm pretty sure they're raspberries. While the flavour was very mild, the seeds were right and I didn't die afterwards. I deviated very slightly from the route at one point to go straight ahead rather then taking a right, two lefts and another right to end up in the same place as going ahead would have taken me... effectively I took one side of a square, rather than taking three sides, if that makes sense. I passed some electric fences which had big bright yellow warnings not to touch.

 Of course I wanted to touch it because of that. When I was 3 or 4 my parents had goats, and they were kept in line using electric fencing. Apparently I used to stand there and just hold it. Farmers used to marvel at me. When I encountered this fence back in nowdays I wanted to find out if it was the same. I decided not to cos a) unconscious me in the middle of farmers' fields was not a good idea if it was strong. I've been kinda knocked out by a mains electricity shock once before so I know it's not fun.... and b) I don't know if the voltage/watts/ampage/whateva is similar to the electric fencing of my childhood. I knew it *probably* wasn't strong, because the UK is the sort of place where if a robber stole your knives and cut himself upon them you'd probably be liable somehow.... so having dangerous fencing on your own land would probably get you in trouble. (Aside note: I got shocked quite a bit yesterday when I was plugging Darren's speakers in. They were connected to the mains, and touching them on their own was fine. when I touched the metal PC case it hurt. At first I thought it was static electricity so I touched it again, figuring it had discharged. It took me about four tries to figure out that it wasn't just a small static charge. Then I got freaked out and adrenaline-ey.)

After this I was finally out of farmland and onto the moors. In between the two there was a bit of busy road I had to walk on. It was really only one carwidth in most places but that didn't stop people hurtling down/up it. At one bend there was a <a href="http://www.catwithnoname.com/photos/bamford1/images/12092007342.jpg">small stream</a> that had gotten clogged up with branches and twigs, and instead of running under the road it went over it.  I soon climbed into Bamford Moor proper. It started out with lots of thick, high bracken, sometimes almost head high:

I stopped and had lunch (leftover curry) in the area. It was quite funny sitting down in the bracken and listening to sheep maaaa invisibly from among the green foliage. As I ate lunch it clouded over and changed from sunscreen weather to may-need-the-raincoat weather. I followed the path along to a <a href="http://www.catwithnoname.com/photos/bamford2/images/12092007359.jpg">disused quarry</a>, and then the path simply stopped. I really wished I had a compass at this point. Hopefully I'll buy one on wednesday. I was in an utterly featureless moor so thickly covered in heather that there were NO paths. My legs got sore from walking in knee to mid thigh-high heather. I followed almost non-existent sheep trails whenever I could, which was seldom.

I knew I had to head north for a while and then north east, but the terrain had so little feature I didn't really know where north was. I knew I wasn't going south, but I could have been going NWW without realising it. I don't know. I didn't worry cos the one geographical feature I could see to the far right (Stanage Edge) was my target eventually, so as long as I could see it I wasn't lost. I would have been able to use it as a navigational landmark if it didn't bend halfway through all of a sudden. half of it was running north / south, but half wasn't, and I couldn't clearly see the bend in it where it started to run NW/SE. While I could say "Stanage edge is to my right" I couldn't say "stanage edge is to my right so I must be facing north" cos that wasn't necessarily true. Does that make any sense?

After a while I picked a spot on stanage edge that looked climbable without hardcore rock climbing equipment and decided to head what was probably due east towards it, again completely cross country and trackless. 

After a while the heather stopped and instead I had marshy <a href="http://www.catwithnoname.com/photos/bamford2/images/12092007371.jpg">sphagnum moss</a> and <a href="http://www.catwithnoname.com/photos/bamford1/images/12092007376.jpg">grassy hummocks</a> to contend with. The grassy hummocks were EVIL hard things that you could walk between (getting your feet wet and tripping on them - they're hard, not soft like they look) or walk ON, like stepping stones. I stepped in some sphagnum moss too, which made a dirty sucky squelchy noise. Sphagnum moss is so water-absorbent that boiled and dried is makes an excellent sterile field wound dressing (says Ray Mears, one of the true gods of the wilderness). It also helps retain moisture in bogs to eventually become peat. (Note: I checked my facts on <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sphagnum_moss">Wikipedia</a> where it says that potentially it can have fungus growing on it that can make it less than safe as a wound dressing. I'll have to look into whether boiling kills the fungus.)

The above is lichen, the red heads marking it as British Soldier lichen, <i>Cladonia cristatella</i>, Also a-growin' in the bog.

More later, I'm tired.
