During a fun ol' game of khet, there was a <strong>crack!</strong> and some of the living room electrical stuff went off. I investigated the crack, which had come from under my desk, and found that the power transformer for the USB hub was blown apart, literally. The top plastic bit was far away from the main bit that was plugged into the socket, and there was heat damage evident in the plastic. Admittedly, it WAS <a href="http://www.ebuyer.com/product/92027">Ebuyer extra value</a>, but still..... exploding after about an hour of use? We're gonna return them now... *l*
