<a href="http://www.ping.fm">PingFM</a> is what you need for all your social networking needs if you blog, twitter, facebook, flickr, etc..... combine em all into one and update one site once to have it propagate to all your various sites. So you can add ones you thought you should register but couldn't be bothered to, and keep everything in sync.... I'm sold, and I only discovered it yesterday. Add pingFM as a contact on an IM, and you can IM the pingFM bot to update your status / blog / whatever. .. or email it... (hmm, that won't be blocked at work!) or use one of the various apps about to "ping" your status.  There are filters, so you can ping only one service, or one TYPE of service if you prefer.... The only big lacks I've seen are that the msn bot doesn't work very well, and it doesn't link with picasa, even though it has other google services, like blogger and Gtalk.
