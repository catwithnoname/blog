I went on one of my regular canal cyclerides along the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chesterfield_Canal">Chesterfield canal</a> this afternoon. I'd started off in a bit of a sulk, since I'm sick of all the same places, and I'm struggling to find pretty areas I've not been to much.  The criteria for pretty is not met by Nottinghamshire farm fields or city/town areas, but I really should be grateful for the canal. It's always full of surprises.  

I took a roundabout route to get to the far end of the canal, via Thorpe Salvin, and discovered a <a href="http://www.j31.co.uk/thorhall.htm">pretty ruin</a>. I was amused that Thorpe hall in ruins fascinated me, but a neary manor house in good repair - that otherwise looked similar - didn't interest me. Why does broken appeal more? Thorpe hall will be accessible in july for a garden show if I understand the interwebs correctly, so I shall have to get a closer look in summer. 

I was please to find a nice little offroad route down to the canal that I've never seen before, after I passed the hall. I will try it out coming home one day when I get off the train early, but I fear I may struggle to do offroad+steep uphill on a Brompton...

The highlight of the day was surely the snake I saw swimming in the canal. I sorta vaguely knew there were snakes in Britain, mostly because of a <a href="http://catwithnoname.com/wordpress/?p=11">sign telling me so</a> that I encountered a couple of years ago. This is the first one I've actually seen here, though. At first I thought the blurring behind the moorhen was its chicks bustling about, but after rubbing my eyes and remembering that the chick would be black, not brown, I re-inspected the curious Something in the water. I decided it was a snake, un-decided it because surely there aren't snakes here, it's too cold, and then re-decided that it was a legless reptile, because after all, what else is long and thin and undulating in a canal? It was between half a meter and a meter in length, and judging by its colouring I think it was probably a <a href="http://www.wildlifebritain.com/thegrasssnake.php"> grass snake </a>. It certainly wasn't an adder - no diamond pattern on its back. I watched it for quite a while as it slither and nosed at the canal bank from the water. I suppose it was probably looking for birds and their chicks / eggs since it's the right time of year right now. Eventually it crossed over to look at my side of the canal, which afforded me some great glimpses, and would have afforded me a great photo if ****ing twidroid hadn't chosen to crash on me. Once it came to my side of the canal I couldn't watch it, since the water plants obscured it too much. 

The rest of the bikeride was easy and fun, with several canada goslings, some mean non-canada geese that are always rude, a swan that was also rude to me, and some cute ducklings. Regular canal stuff really, but still lovely. I was far less sulky and far happier by the end.
