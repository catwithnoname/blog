Now, I know it's silly but I can't help loving <a href="http://icanhascheezburger.com/">lolcats</a>. I actually have a lolcat application installed on my G1 so I can check for new lolcats at all times, and I wish I had the wit to create them from our sweet little anklebiter beast. But nothing surpasses the hilarity of combining lolcats and coding! <a href='http://lolcode.com/keywords/keywords'>LOLCODE</a>. I love the examples.. The first one being, of course, "Hai world".....
