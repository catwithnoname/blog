A while ago I was speculating about the purpose of the many <a href="http://catwithnoname.com/wordpress/?p=258">cairns</a> one sees up on popular walking sites. <a href="http://www.go4awalk.com/news/154_cairns.php">go4awalk.com</a> points out that they can be ruining historical cairns in the process, and misleading to navigation. So there, another excuse not to add to them just because of witch superstitions. 

I need to go for another walk. Too much life and too little wlaking and cycling sometimes.
