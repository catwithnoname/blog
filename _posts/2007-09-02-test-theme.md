<a href="http://www.catwithnoname.com/wordpresstest/">http://www.catwithnoname.com/wordpresstest/</a> I've been tinkering about with this for the past few days. It seems too...... empty to me, and I do kinda like the one I have now. I'm wondering if a blue glassy gradient background might help, but I'm in windows and don't have any image editing tools available and I can't be bothered installing photoshop. It all started originally when I read some tutorials about how to do glass buttons and it was like.... Duh! of course they're that easy!
