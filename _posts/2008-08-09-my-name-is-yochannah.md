It rhymes with "runner" - the way I say runner, at least. If you're the type that actually pronounces that final "R" then perhaps you should rhyme it with "gunna" as in "I'm gunna complain about people saying my name wrong". (I'd normally spell that gonna, and not gunna, but it's a colloquial word in either case so does it really matter how it's spelled?).

Nowhere in my first name is there the letter "J". There never has, and never will be. Why, then, do so many people who've known me for a long time pronounce or spell my name with a J, or pronounce my names as though it rhymes with Hannah or Anna?

People who don't know me are perfectly entitled to garble my name. Yochannah is a long name in english and it's not common <em>anywhere</em> I've lived. I wouldn't even be grumpy at a good friend who got the amount of "N"s or "H"s in my name wrong... I often see yochana, yohanna or other variant misspellings made by people I am acquainted with. I'll generally correct the erring party, but I don't really mind if it's misspelled like that. 

Thankfully it's almost impossible to spell it wrong in hebrew. Not completely impossible, but Chana is a very common name in hebrew - and all you need to do is as the "yo" bit to the start to make it Yochannah in hebrew. 

When I was little my name was Yohannah, without the c that makes the "ccchhhhhh". My grandparents could never say it right, latching on to the familiar bit and making it rhyme with Hannah. It seems strange to me that grandparents wouldn't try to say their grandchild's name right, but that's how it was, and still is, I guess, if they ever say it at all.

Karen used to pronounce it the same way, or even pronounce it starting with a j sometimes - and once got pissed off at me for asking her NOT to tell other people that was my name. I honestly don't think it's unreasonable to ask someone you know not to tell people your name is something that it isn't... but we didn't get on for more reasons than just my name, I suppose. 

I've never, ever once spelled my name with a J, or introduced myself as Johana or Jehanna or whatever the heck some people think it is... but people still somehow seem to deduce that they should call me by that name. It's incredibly frustrating and it makes me hate the name more and more every time. It makes me feel.... hostile.... I think. 

The other day someone I know who lives in the same settlement as my parents added me as a friend in facebook. (I'll save the I-hate-facebook rant for a different time, I'm busy on the "Yochannah" rant now) We've probably been acquainted for a decade or so. In the friend invitation she said... 

"Johanna, just wanted to know what's new with you".
