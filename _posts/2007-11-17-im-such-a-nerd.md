I'm excited about my upcoming project. This is my fourth course in a sequential set of six. Each of the End of Course Assessments (henceforth known as ECAs) make up 82% of my final grade for the course. The first ECA was about A&B Pots and Pans, a fictitious company who wanted a website. We made it for them. Next course, they wanted an <em>interactive</em> website, so we gave them Javascript. Then we gave them server side scripting. This ECA, they want to scale up and get Coldfusion and mySQL. 50% of my marks will be the coding!! yay!!! All the previous courses the report made up 60%-75% and the coding counted little. I shall not be thwarted this time, however. The coding is the easy bit! Mwahahahahahahahaha!

I'm that kid in school who actually -likes- homework and is hated by the class for it. *lol*

And yet.... watch me whine about being rushed in a week or three.
