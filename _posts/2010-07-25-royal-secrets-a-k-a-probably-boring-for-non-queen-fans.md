I've been a fan of Queen pretty much all my life - the very first music album I bought myself was Queen's Day at the Races (or possibly Night at the Opera! I can't believe memory fails me...). They have a lot of obscure songs that I never really considered the meanings of too much. Some are obvious, like <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_Night_at_the_Opera_(Queen_album)#Death_on_Two_Legs_.28Dedicated_to....29">Death on Two Legs</a>. The song is clearly about their hate of someone, who was the ex-band manager.....

A couple of years ago I was astounded to find out that one of my many favourite songs had far more background than I knew... Neil Gaiman posted about a painting called <a href="http://journal.neilgaiman.com/2008/04/fairy-fellers-master-stroke.html">the fairy feller's master stroke</a>. Previously I'd only known the phrase as the title of a <a href="http://listen.grooveshark.com/#/s/The+Fairy+Feller+s+Master+Stroke/19MUQy">Queen song</a>, so I had great fun listening to the song whilst looking at the painting and trying to identify which painted characters they were singing about. I also felt a bit like an uncultured philistine for not knowing where the original references came from.... It seems akin to someone mentioning Romeo and Juliet and me saying "oh yeah, I've seen that film...." 

Today I came across another one with more meaning than I knew: <a href="http://listen.grooveshark.com/#/s/+39/1VDbjA">'39</a>. I love the sound of the song, but never *quite* got it. The <a href="http://www.lyricsfreak.com/q/queen/39_20112598.html">lyrics seemed to be about colonisation</a>, but the uneven ageing didn't make much sense. I sort of assumed it was some sort of strange magic, since there are a lot of Queen songs that are fantasy based (not usually the ones that made it into the hits though).  Think <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Queen_II#Ogre_Battle">Ogre Battle</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_Night_at_the_Opera_(Queen_album)#The_Prophet.27s_Song">The Prophet's Song</a> (this song MUST be listened to in Stereo or even Surround sound), and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Queen_(album)#.22My_Fairy_King.22">My Fairy King</a>. Anyway, today I was browsing for space-themed songs (not entirely sure why, but I started to put a <a href="http://listen.grooveshark.com/#/playlist/Space/32643158">playlist of space songs</a> together) and came across <a href="http://io9.com/5546948/7-great-space+themed-songs-for-your-next-introspective-montage">a post on io9</a> where '39 was mentioned in the comms as a relativistic space/time travel song. All of a sudden, '39's lyrics clicked into place. 
<blockquote>
For so many years have gone 
Though I'm older but a year 
Your mother's eyes from your eyes cry to me.
~ Lyrics from: <a href="http://www.lyricsfreak.com/q/queen/39_20112598.html">LyricsFreak</a>
</blockquote>

That paragraph makes so much sense now.

So, if this interests anyone but Benyamin I shall be surprised... but I shall have to make a note to look into Queen lyrics more carefully from now on. Also, I should really complete my album set. I only have A Day at the Races, A Night at the Opera, Queen, Queen II, Sheer Heart Attack, A Kind of Magic, Made In Heaven, and some various Greatest Hits. 

Fuck me. It's really nearly 20 years since <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freddie_Mercury">Freddie</a> died... :(
