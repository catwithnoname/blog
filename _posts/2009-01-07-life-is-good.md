Darren's dad discharged on monday, which was a bit of a surprise to us all. He can't mobilise on his own properly yet, but he's well equipped at home. From previous hospitalisations he's gotten pretty well equipped - he has a zimmer frame both upstairs and downstairs, and a stairlift to get between the two. His chair in the living room has a special control thingy that he can use to recline completely, or even help him stand up and get out of the chair. So he's doing very well at home. We're the taxi drivers (using their car) since I'm the only one in the family who can drive legally at the moment. 

Having life return to normal after a huge scare makes normal life seem so much more special. I've had a pretty darn good life the last few years, and I have recognised the fact - but I'm feeling extra shiny right now :).

Now I'm going to go and spend the Amazon gift certificate I got from <a href="http://uk.hi-epanel.com">Harris Interactive</a>.
