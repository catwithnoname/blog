How cool is Motionbased? <a href="http://trail.motionbased.com/trail/invitation/email/accept.mb?senderPk.pkValue=189193&unitSystemPkValue=2&episodePk.pkValue=4876350">My walk last wednesday</a>. Stats, graphs, all grabbed from my GPS. Click on dashboard to see it in all its niftiness. I bet you can guess which bit of the altitude graph was the scary ascent! *lol* Viewing a larger map in google maps with the satellite imagery was pretty cool, too.
