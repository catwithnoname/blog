Had the <a href="http://www.bia.homeoffice.gov.uk/britishcitizenship/applying/checkingservice/#header1">nationality checking service</a> appointment on thursday. It went smoothly and all my forms and evidence were present and ok. The response time at the moment is not as bad as the 6 months the Border Agency claims it could take - the fastest the checking service lady had seen was 3 weeks, but normally it's more like 2-3 months. I've gone from nervous to excited in hopes that soon I'll be a citizen. 

Beats the dream I had a few days before the appointment, where I found out my house was not fashionable enough for me to ever be a citizen... and I was told be my Sensei, of all people! Darn wacky dreams. I had planned to hire a designer and everything!
