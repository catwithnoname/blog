So, the full album is huge, and has of some weird photos of the car dashboard? But <a href="http://picasaweb.google.com/yochannah/NorthWalesCampingOct08#">here</a> is the main album. I think I may have given up on my pretty flash galleries.


But otherwise a few of my favourites: 
<a href="http://picasaweb.google.com/lh/photo/ismNu3ZH9xKq4-ejs6082Q"><img src="http://lh4.ggpht.com/_PTKgtA2c9II/SQ9kNAF8RTI/AAAAAAAAAYY/w7cGSynvG2s/s288/P1010676.JPG" /></a> The waterfall at Betws-y-coed (which I think is pronounced Bettis-ee-cowid..?).

<a href="http://picasaweb.google.com/lh/photo/x1K7FKgqsDHFdom-vSMVoA"><img src="http://lh5.ggpht.com/_PTKgtA2c9II/SQ9n_g4_SYI/AAAAAAAAAr4/9N3_JTplwjY/s288/P1010835.JPG" /></a> One of the ruined houses (and a bit of me!). The ruined houses were astoundingly exciting - sticking our heads up spiderwebbed chimneys, identifying what rooms might have been or where a collapsed hearth was, finding highly rusted iron bars propping things up, identifying slate roof tiles (on the floor), noticing bits of old plaster that had crumbled, and generally playing Indiana Jones.

<a href="http://picasaweb.google.com/lh/photo/LafJAbWRAqrSVhj3AC3toA"><img src="http://lh4.ggpht.com/_PTKgtA2c9II/SQ9qbAxowxI/AAAAAAAAA2I/S_0dnz705pA/s288/P1010932.JPG" /></a> When can I move to Wales? This is looking out over Llanberis (the town) and Llyn Padarn (the lake). 

<a href="http://picasaweb.google.com/lh/photo/myqQJExty4kQl5mBbwVQxQ"><img src="http://lh6.ggpht.com/_PTKgtA2c9II/SQ9q4YbNGwI/AAAAAAAAA4E/4fpB6XvUJDw/s288/P1010949.JPG" /></a> Steps up to (and part of) the slate quarry hospital. We also passed the mortuary. The quarry in question doesn't appear to be active anymore, although there does appear to be active quarrying nearby, but it's a dire profession that needed its own hospital - and a place to store bodies...  Talking of slate, a wee bit later on that day I was just commenting to Darren that I thought it was sensible and economical to use local resources, but really, did they have to make EVERYTHING in the area out of slate? when we turned the corner and passed the <a href="http://www.museumwales.ac.uk/en/slate/">Wales national slate museum</a>... *lol*.

<a href="http://picasaweb.google.com/lh/photo/D1S54GGdAc6AGWL-O_k8KQ"><img src="http://lh3.ggpht.com/_PTKgtA2c9II/SQ9rBKLnhvI/AAAAAAAAA44/7JGTGRCBaY4/s288/P1010955.JPG" /></a> Last one: The castle in Llanberis. It has shit scary spiral stairs that didn't have any railing. I still had to go to the top, but I was crawling most of the way both ways, cos falling just wouldn't have been any fun. I thought York Minster stairs were fun but a bit scary, these were waaay worse, despite the fact that they were also a lot shorter. Darren didn't even come up, just asked if there was anything to see *l*.
