I think. A couple of evenings battling with PHP and <a href="http://www.gimp.org/">the GIMP</a>. Darren pointed out to me AFTER I'd done the hat that the proportions are all wrong and the hole doesn't match up with the bit of the hat where your head goes in, but I'd just spent ages getting the line art right and I didn't want to do it again. The mouse I have atm is AWFUL, can't even draw a straight line. So I ended up taking a photo of a hand drawn hat (too lazy to find and install the flatbed scanner) and then tracing over it with the pen tool, then stroking it to get that sleek vector-ey feel. It looked better when it wasn't a .gif. If only IE had good .png support I would not have had to have such pixellated edges! I think IE 7 is supposed to cope with PNGs better but loads of people with pirate xp will not have bothered working around and figuring how to upgrade from 6. IE 6 just can't cope cos it's poopy.

As long as someone tells me it fools them into thinking it's a bit like a hat I'll be happy.
