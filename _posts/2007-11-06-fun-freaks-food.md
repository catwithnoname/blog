....... we're back from Scotland now (howcome it always goes so fast?!).

Priorities for today: 
<ul>
<li>Catch up on all my internet stuff (RSS feeds, forums, etc.... Mostly already done.)</li>
<li>Get CWNN home from the cattery (soon, YAY!!!!!!)</li>
<li>Study</li>
<li>Begin the assignment due on the 16th. (I'll probably do most of it on a quiet day at work or during lunch, but starting early it can't hurt.)</li>
<li>Do some serious blogging tonight about the last few days</li>
<li>Upload the pics, probably into a half hundred galleries. There're also a couple of videos of seals moving about on the beach.</li>
</ul>
