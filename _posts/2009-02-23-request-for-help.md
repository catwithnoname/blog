This is an email I got from my mum a few days ago. In short - my sister has Attention Deficit Disorder - ADD, and attends a special school that is able to deal with young people who have ADD / ADHD. The school is in bad debt due to government funding being withdrawn, so any help at all would be appreciated, even if it's only a few pounds / dollars / euros / whatever. If you can help, feel free to contact me (yochannah-at-gmail-dot-com) or the school directly. It'll mean a lot to me, my family, and especially my sister.

Hi,  dear friends and relatives.

I want to tell you all, about Aviella and her school.

She is in her second year at high school and is now learning at  Neve Ruchama  Academy in Jerusalem.  There are no high schools in our town. 

She gets up at 5am each school day to catch the first bus of the day at 5.45am bus from our town of Eli to Jerusalem - she travels with her father, who is going in to work, which makes the early  wake-up a little easier.  This bus usually arrives at the Jerusalem central bus station between 6.45am and 7.00am; then she catches another bus across Jerusalem to  the school, an  approximately 30 minute journey to make it to school in time for the 8.00am start.  She has to go on the earliest bus, because if she took the second bus of the morning from our town, she would be late for school  every day.

School finishes most days at 4.30pm, so she travels back to the bus station and usually gets the 5.30pm bus home, which arrives in our town between 6.50pm and 7pm.  Some days, there are so many travellers that the bus is full, and the driver does not  let any more people on and she has to wait for the 6.30pm bus home.

A long day and a lot of travelling for a teenager, you think?  That's what we thought, so for her first year of high school  we sent to the same school  (Tzviah in Jerusalem) as Michaela , who was in her last year there.  We thought it would make things easier for her to have a sister
at school with her. Also, the school is on the bus route, at the last stop before the central bus station, thus avoiding the extra travel across Jerusalem both ways each day.

However, Aviella has ADD (attention deficit disorder, without the hyperactivity part, that more often affects boys).  She is taking medication which helps, but she sometimes skipped classes last year and did not always do classwork or homework.  One week, after promising the  school counsellor she would try harder, she skipped a class and so they suspended her for a few days, until we could have a meeting with the  counsellor, her main teacher and the  teacher who was  in charge of managing all the  ninth grade classes.    I, personally, do not see the logic of punishing a child who has skipped classes, with  more time off - seems more like a reward to  me, but that's what they do here.

At the meeting, the manager teacher basically said, we do not know what to do to help Aviella , so she can't come back.   [We heard later that this woman was fired for this act and other things she did without consulting higher management].

At this stage, with 2 months of the school year to go, we contacted the headmistress  of her current school (Mrs Cissie Slokovski), because we had heard good things about the school , and had only been put off by the travel time.

Cissie met with us the next day, and explained that  her teachers had training in dealing with children with ADD.  She also advised of  a special short course of sessions with a psychologist, who makes a formal diagnosis and report, with recommendations (eg extra time in exams) to help  children with ADD or ADHD.   This report and its recommendations are usually  accepted by the Education department.   Somehow, the previous school had not told  us about this at all.

Aviella started at Neve Ruchama the next week with private lessons, to catch her up in some subjects, so she would be at the same level with the other girls, when she started full time there, in the new school year from Sept 2008.

Now, we finally get to the point of my story; sorry for taking so long to get there.   Schools in Israel are not fully funded by the government.  I have heard it said that Israel has the most expensive "free" education system in the world.  We pay about a thousand shekels a month (about  Â£170) for tuition, plus extra for any other things required, such as remedial teaching.  Also,  we pay for text books , they are not provided by the school.

Neve Ruchama, as a school with a high number of students with ADD or ADHD, was receiving extra subsidies from the  government, to other schools. The school borrowed ahead for its needs, in anticipation of the  subsidies. However, the government in its wisdom, stopped these from the end of last school year.  So, the school has a large debt to pay.  A few months ago, the school became affiliated with the youth movement, Benei Akiva (BA), so now more funds are available through  BA.

But, BA did  not take on  past debt, so the school still has to pay off previous loans (hundreds of thousands $US).  A payment is due soon.
To save money, sport classes have been cut for now, and teachers have not been paid their salaries  for a while.

My point is this: if anyone of you can make a donation, large or small, or knows of anyone rich and famous, or not rich and famous, who can make a donation to help save the school that helped save our  daughter, Aviella, please contact the school.
