MmmmmmmmMMmmmmMMmmmmm. We went to <a href="http://www.sakushi.co.uk/home/">Sakushi</a> tonight. It's one of those conveyor-belt sushi places where you take what you want off the belt as it goes past your table, and you know how much it will cost based on the colours of the plates that you choose. I sorta wound up with 8 different plates for me - I think Darren had 4 or 5 and a large plate of noodles.  I had fun breathing wasabi fumes down my nose and making it burn (a curious experience). Most of all I like the flavour of the mixed seaweed / rice / fish / veggie type rolls. And I came to the conclusion that I do not really like roe. The popping sensation as I ate it was quite disturbing. Ich.

The chicken teriyaki was magnificent, and was the only item I had to order specially that didn't come around on the belt. I also loved the yellowtail nigiri - its texture was quite strange, though. Darren thought it tasted like ham. I just thought it felt like maybe it was cooked. I dunnnooooo.

The bill was less magnificent. I don't remember ever spending Â£50 at a restaurant. It was worth it though - last time we had (real) sushi was before we married, and it's nearly our 5th anniversary now.....
