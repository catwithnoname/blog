Badness: I spoke to mum, and she told me Deedee (<a href="http://www.catwithnoname.com/photos/Israel%202007%20Gallery%201/images/P1000362.JPG">1 pic</a>, and <a href="http://www.catwithnoname.com/photos/Israel%202007%20Gallery%201/images/P1000365.JPG">another</a> - Deedee has the red coloured collar) was dead. Stupid snakes!!! It got <a href="http://www.catwithnoname.com/photos/Israel%202007%20Gallery%201/images/P1000358.JPG">Shake</a> as well, but last I heard earlier today he had a huge swollen jaw but seemed likely to survive. Apparently mum gave him a human antihistamine *l*. It's weird that my parents had five dogs for a decade and then within about a period of a year there were two snake attacks, killing three of them and hurting a fourth. 

Oh yeah... that pic of Shake, shakey's the furry creature in the front, not the one in the background *g*

Goodness:

<ul>
<li>Cycling glasses. They're clear, polarised and have a rubberised bridge and various other bits to keep it sitting on your face whilst doing bikey things. When you're cycling, loads of stuff flies into your face, bugs and dust and rain. Plain ol' sunglasses don't do the job and are too dark in wintertime or evenings. </li>
<li>A signed, numbered, first edition of American Gods.</li>
<li>A dynamo LED lamp. Darren said we can go camping sometime soon!!!!!!! YAY!!!!!!!!</li>
<li>An Amazon gift certificate. Booooooooooooooooooooooooooooks!!</li>
<li>A running bumbag. It's huge compare to a normal bumbag, has an airflow system designed into it, and holds a bottle as well.</li>
<li>A small personal first aid kit. You can tell my beloved worries about me when I wander out on the moors and peaks *g*.</li>
<li>A travel case with room for me Eee and accessories!!!! I've wanted one for a while!!</li>
</ul>
