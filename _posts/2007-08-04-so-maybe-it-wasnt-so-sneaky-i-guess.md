it's not that it snuck up reaaaalllly, I suppose, more that it just doesn't feel like it should be august yet.  I did notice june and july and the months before those. We have to pay a lot of attention to dates here at work too cos we have OLAs to meet. I'm not sure why we dont't call them SLAs, which is the term I've heard almost everywhere else.

I had a cool dream the other night I visited New York and lolo invited us to drop by. (cos NY's soooo close to montreal that you only need to take an overnight bus *L*) we watched some weird show with her that was hard to see cos the audience was in the way mostly and there were lots of silhouetted heads more than anything else. We then went to a cafe somewhere (on the way there were loads of shops with hebrew signs and I was so excited Iwanted to move to canada) and sat out on the street and lolo ordered poutine (which she called tomato sauce but I know it was really poutine just weirdness-ed cos of my dream) and I ordered a latte and we were having a great time... when my alarm went off and woke me!!!! bastard thing!!!!!

I'm gonna sit back and read for the last hour of work now, cos I can't remember the last time I read for any length of time, which is bleh.

I have NO red sauce on my white top. None.
