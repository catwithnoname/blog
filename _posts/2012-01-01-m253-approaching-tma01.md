I've been overcome with a now-rare desire to get out some thoughts in a longer format than a tweet. I've been doing <a href="http://www3.open.ac.uk/study/undergraduate/course/m253.htm">M253</a> for just over a month now, and it's done little but make me feel sick, sick, sick. It's a 10 point course - most degree-related courses are 30 or 60 points - but costs nearly as much as a 30 pointer, which seems unfair.

It's designed to teach you about distributed teamwork - that is, teamwork between members at disparate locations. I've worked in IT for the last 6 or 7 years, by its nature distributed (remote support, for example, is hardly face to face!), and I've yet to encounter such a demoralising and stressful situation. We're told to sort ourselves out into team roles, establish team rules, distribute work, etc. Unfortunately no one really seems to give a flying fuck about doing this and I feel like I'm left with:

<ol>
<li>Taking the same laid back stance as everyone else and hoping someone else will get off their butt and try to get work done.</li>
<li>Doing what I'm currently doing, which is staying fake-positive in the forums, wiki, and emails, gently trying to remind people of deadlines, asking for input from others that's never responded to, and all the while worrying that I'm making too much noise and everyone's just annoyed and ignoring me</li>
<li>Doing everything I possibly can myself and ignoring the lack of / very slow contributions. But there's no "I" in teamwork, and all that bullshit.</li>
</ol>

Another worry I have is related to a section of the course literature:

<blockquote>
Since the module aims to test the process of team working, being able to demonstrate active participation in the team is very important. The marking of this TMA may include penalties against students who cannot demonstrate active participation in the team tasks. 
</blockquote>

I'm reasonably sure that my frustratedly loudmouth tactics can't be ignored as "active participation", but I'm worried about some of the quieter team members. A reminder would probably just piss them off (it would me). Sigh. This course just fills me with horrible angst every time I think about it. Reading reviews online doesn't help, at all. Like:
<ul>
<li> <a href="http://www3.open.ac.uk/coursereviews/course.aspx?course=M253">the official OU reviews</a></li>
<li> <a href="http://iamou.blogspot.com/2007/04/m253-soul-destroyer.html">"M253 - Soul Destroyer"</a></li>
<li> <a href="http://eddgreen.com/index.php?mode=3&selection=7">"a bunch of w***y b******s"</a></li>
<li> <a href="http://m253academia.wordpress.com/">this entire blog - but my favourite bit is where the author lists all of their favourite things in lieu of M253, including necrotic bowel syndrome</a>.</li>
</ul>

So far, the only upside is that it's only pass/fail so my desire for the highest scores possible doesn't matter, and it  doesn't finish with an exam.
