I've gathered prettymuch everything I need and filled out the forms. There are a couple of things I will need to hunt through old paper work for (like my exact date of moving out of our previous address and into this one), but the application was far less difficult that expected.  For my permanent residence application I had to provide a 2 or 3 centimetres thick collection of forms and supporting evidence, but for citizenship it seems I need far less. They'll accept my passports as sufficient evidence that I was in the country for the qualifying 3 year period prior to now. My life in the UK test pass certificate and my marriage certificate are prettymuch all I need apart from that. 

I've asked both people who are going to be referees to vouch for my good character, and even managed to find one that was part of a professional organisation (btw, Shaun - I would have picked on you if you still lived in the UK!!)

Next steps: get an appointment with Sheffield nationality checking service who will check I've filled the forms out correctly,  get a passport photograph, shell out the astronomical fee. Then wait 2-4 weeks for the application to be acknowledged, then  6 months (hopefully no longer) until I get the results confimed. 

I will feel so much better when, half a year or so from now, I (hopefully) finally have confirmation that I can live in the country I've chosen to make my life without restriction, and with the rights everyone else are allowed. Oh, and a Citizenship ceremony.
