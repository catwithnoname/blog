It's not... HBOS and Lloyds TSB anymore, it's.... Lloydbos? HBOS TSB? It's all one, in any case. We've been speculating endlessly at work about whether any changes will take weeks or months or more than a year, whether HBOS will stay with FSC or not.... etc. But no one had any idea at all, obviously.  Will hundreds or thousands of people be out of jobs before christmas? I may dislike christmas but I can appreciate the pall it will cast on many people's lives if they were jobless for it. Dare we spend any money? Should we not do all of out planned trips, to ireland or my bikeride? Suckyness. 

I think prettymuch all of us will be updating our CVs.  

Weirdly, I'd been considering the fact that I got my final result for my Cert in Web Apps yesterday. I'd been wondering if it was time to start looking to move on, to progress into web development, but I thought I was comfy and happy in a secure long term job in FSC. heheh.
