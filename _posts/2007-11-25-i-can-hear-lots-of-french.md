Darren's playing Day of Defeat on a French server with voice chat, so we can hear everything they say. It involves killing people not on your team and not killing people on the other team, so there's no real need for him to understand what they're saying. So I'm sitting and studying to a stream of yummy-accented nonsense. Occasionally I recognise a word, which is far more exciting that it should be. 

On an exciting-er note I finally got my semi-annual bonus in this paycheque. It was less than it should have been due to the fact I'm still paying too much tax. I actually got pissed off so much I finally did something about it and contact the local tax office and our HR department. I don't know how long it'll take to sort out, but it's in motion now. Somehow the tax people didn't know I'm under a permanent contract with Fujitsu Siemens even though I've been employed by them directly since March. (While I was working for FSC beforehand they paid an agency to employ me so they weren't directly my employers).  I'm pretty sure I filled out all the right forms in March but I guess I either missed one or it got lost in the works somewhere. I've had that happen to me before... I was working for the NHS for about 3 months before I actually got a proper paycheque. Yech. 

With the bonus's help I purchaseded myself a nicer desk than the one I have at the moment. It was <a href="http://www.furnitureatwork.co.uk/WebConnect/MainServlet?storeId=FaW&catalogId=webconnect&langId=en_GB&action=ProductDisplay&screenlabel=index&route=000147.000319.000325.000335&productId=13630"> one of these</a> in cherry, smaller size, left return. I have been wanting a new desk for a while now - the biggest reason is that when I do my Uni work I don't ever have enough space to spread out (even if the desk is tidy *lol*). While <a href="http://www.focusdiy.co.uk/invt/55330">my current desk</a> seemed like a great idea when we bought it - it's a typical all-in-one home office workstation, full of CD racks and cubbyholes - it is actually far too busy. That pic in link is a similar one by the same company since they seem to have stopped doing mine. The cubbyholes and shelves are all too small, and I don't use the CD rack.  Mostly they just collect junk. The keyboard shelf is just plain too low to be good for your wrists and I really don't want more physio for wrist pains. I use my mouse in my left hand at work and my right hand at home to spread the strain. It's not as hard to get used to as you think. After two days I was a pro lefty. I even have an automatic dialler program for my phone so that I can copy / paste phone numbers on my PC rather than dialling them in with my hands. Heck, I stopped lifting dumbbells and using the multigym because that seemed to aggravate my wrists. So all in all, unsupported wrists on keyboard shelf = bad. The keyboard's been living on top of my desk instead of underneath for months, which limits my desk space even further.  To add to all that there's not enough footroom so I often end up sitting skewed. I've not had back problems to date but I'd really rather not start!

I also got a noticeboard to stick on the wall... just a cheapo cork board really, some translucent pins (cos translucent is better than opaque!) and a document stand. The cork board will be great for reference texts like operators and syntax for whatever language I happen to be fiddling with at the time. CSS background-repeat always foils me - I try and try, but goshdarnit I can never remember whether X is vertical or whether it's Y. I have to have a note stuck up somewhere to remind me. Darren thinks it's funny I can't remember.  

The noticeboard will require us to cut out some of the dado rail which means before we sell this house in a few years or whenever we'll have to completely remove the rail and either replace it entirely or repaper / smooth out the walls somehow. I'm not particularly fond of dado rails anyway. I'm not particularly fond of dado rails anyway.... Actually, here's a pic of my <span style="text-decoration:line-through">mess</span> desk and the dado rail behind me:
