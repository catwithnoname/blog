[simage=1032,400,y,none] So far, the tomatoes are growing happily in the bathroom where it's warm and quite moist. It might be a good idea to plant them out soon, thinking about it, since it's warm now. I love how all of their leaves train toward the sunny windows like the miniature green solar panels they are. They have beautiful little yellow flowers and the lovely distinctive tomato-ey smell. 

My cucumbers, unfortunately, didn't like the cold outside and all three died :( The dwarf french green beans haven't grown at all since they've been planted out and may be too short on sunlight. There is a lot of grass gowing in their patch too, and I'm unsure how to kill it without killing legit plants. Oodles of hand weeding?

On the other hand, the radish seeds have sprouted and seem to be happy with life. I think I need to thin them out so I don't get hundreds of malforms too-close-to-each-other radishes:

The highlight of them all has to be the fresh salad leaf section, which is flourishing (except for the lettuces, which mysteriously died in droves for no reason). They're all living in grow bags, and I snip off a handful or three for me most meals. I do feel bad for Darren, because he doesn't really like random leaves as much as the lettuces that died. I just have NO idea why they died in the first place. [simage=1045,400,y,none] 

My favourite nommest leaves are the Mizuna: [simage=1046,400,y,none]
