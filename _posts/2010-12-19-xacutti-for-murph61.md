<a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/food/recipes/magoasxacutti_89994">Xacutti</a> from the BBC food website was for tea today, and was very pleasant, but OW HOT. 

Alterations: 
<ul>
	<li>Being vegetarian, I used quorn fillets instead of a segmented chicken.</li>
 <li>I omitted:
 <ul>
   <li> The cinnamon, which I strongly dislike </li>
   <li> The poppy seeds (because there weren't any at Tesco yesterday and I didn't have time to search further afield) </li>
   <li>the peanuts, because my mother in law thinks she gets unwell from some nuts. She's fine with pine nuts and coconut for sure (mostly because I've fed her them by accident in curries and pestos) and it's not <a href="http://www.nhs.uk/conditions/Anaphylaxis/Pages/Introduction.aspx">Anaphylactic Shock</a> that she goes into, just am upset tummy.... so who knows. </li>
  </ul></li>
<li>Chilli substitution. It called for six kashmiri chillies. I used three chillies from a pack at Tesco marked as strength 2 out of 5. The chillies got whirrrrrrrred into a paste, but the paste made me cough when I was near it. Errrrr..... hot. </li>
</ul>

Impressions: Overall, pleasantly flavoursome. It had three onions but WASN'T unpleasantly onion-ey - possibly because the onions were overwhelmed by all the other seeds I toasted and ground, the fresh coconut, and the fresh coriander. (OM NOM NOM!!) The lime garnish was lovely too - but I'm obsessed with limes so I might not be the best judge. The heat was a big big problem, though. I've cooked enough BBC curry recipes to know that generally they like to kill foolish individuals who obey the chilli count, and I'd adjusted by using three chillies. Or so I thought. MIL said it was the hottest curry she's ever been willing to eat. D said it was nearly like a Vindaloo. I had a drink of milk and some yoghurt on the side, and thought it no hotter than many curries I've had at a curry house.

I wish I'd remembered to take a photo....
