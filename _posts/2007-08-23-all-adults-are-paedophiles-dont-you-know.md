Between the building I work at and the nearby "Kidz @ Work" there is a little strip of grass. Being cooped up in a building all day, people like to sit on it during their lunchtimes, if it's sunny. 

We got an email going about, saying that it was a child protection issue and we could no longer sit there. There's a 2.5 metre high fence between the playground and the grass.  It's made of metal bars. AFAIK the kids don't go out to the playground unsupervised. 

Is it me, or is this a wee bit OTT?

 I wish I'd been not allowed to sit near the  kids on the train yesterday who endlessly said "are we there yet? are we there yet?". They were annoying.

A nicer thing is it's a dress down day tomorrow. YAY.
