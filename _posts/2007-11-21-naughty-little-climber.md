<br /><br /><br /><br />Kittycattens do not go on fridges! We thought she couldn't get up there, but when I got home this morning after my driving lesson I was greeted by a little "hrrrrrrrrr" from above. She's a sneaky little critter! I'm not sure if she could really get down or not, either. Cats are jumpy creatures but this one's a coward! I left her there at first but after a while when she didn't come down I picked her up and removed her. In most cases I support just letting cats jump down when they want. Do they realllllly need firemen? I doubt it. Reuters mentioned an <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/oddlyEnoughNews/idUSN1356903220071113"> extreme pet rescue </a> the other day, come to think of it. 

She seemed to have a must-climb-now bug in her though, because she climbed onto Darren's desk (forbidden) and then on the TV (double forbidden). Twice. Both  times as soon as I stood up and spoke to her in the Angry-At-Naughty-Cats voice she hurried down... she obviously knew I'd not like her up there. *l*
