Are you ready? will you get it?

I suppose I should ;) but usually I use Chrome. It syncs, and I don't have to reboot it when I install an extension, and it's prettier. I already have ff 3.6 and ff4 at work of course (although I'm chagrined that IE9 can't be run on XP. This is a VERY big lack in my eyes. Sigh)

I love my work at the moment, really truly. I've been doing Google Analytics work today, and working on automating image resizing for the website product photos. I'm getting paid for this stuff, internet stuff! I hope the shine doesn't wear off any time soon. I know there is a long line of satellite websites in my future, and some of that will be samey, but some will be new creative bursts every time, suiting the design of the site to the specific needs of the products it'll be presenting. Having tinkered a lot with my wordpress themes over the years, and helping D tweak his mediawikis and wordpresses and joomlas and whatnot has made me feel pretty darn comfy with modifying presentation whilst keeping content presentable. I have a huge hankering for fixing all the niggles in this site and maybe making one I really love. Is that really possible? Probably if I polish it more than I usually bother with lol.

Talking about redesign, I'm seriously considering to changing my jewellery business name to catwithnoname jewellery, and possibly migrating the blog elsewhere (I have a domain I'm not using that could work or I might get a new one). There're too many "X's handmade jewellery"s out there!! Decisions, decisions!
