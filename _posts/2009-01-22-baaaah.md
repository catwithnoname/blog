Not baah like sheep, just Bah! I broke my beloved brompton yesterday and I can't fix it myself so I have to take it into a bike store and see if they'll fix it (but not the local Halfords cos I LIKE my bike and I don't want bad things done to it). The rear wheel was wonky, so I took it off, and ended overtightening a nut so badly I can't get the rear wheel back on. I may have also damaged the gears, I don't know. 

And I may miss class tonight trying to get it fixed, which sucks even more. I love class! I had a sore throat yesterday because we had to yell a lot last lesson. I like an excuse to yell as loud as I can. I could have used a chance to yell loud last night when I was "fixing" my bike, come to think of it.
