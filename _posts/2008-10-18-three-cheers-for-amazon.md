You now need to buy only one book to get <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/help/customer/display.html/ref=ms_sbrspot_1?%5Fencoding=UTF8&nodeId=200039400&pf_rd_p=223767991&pf_rd_s=gateway-center-column&pf_rd_t=101&pf_rd_i=468294&pf_rd_m=A3P5ROKL5A1OLE&pf_rd_r=0N2MT5Z621TYB7JG14EQ!">free delivery</a>. Super awesome. 

My Java course is being a pain in the butt and progressing in babysteps at the moment. The course requires basic understanding of programming concepts according the the course description, yet it's explaining elementary concepts like arguments in long repetitive boring detail. Argh! This course is worth 30 points, compared to the web apps courses I've been taking, which were worth 10 points each, yet so far the web apps courses have been far more demanding. I'm partway through the third week of the course and there's been NO coding yet!

<a href="http://www.css3.info/">CSS3.info</a> is a site I stumbled across this morning. The preview section was particularly interesting. Reading about CSS3 (and seeing which bits of my browsers support) was nerdily exciting. If you don't know what CSS is, don't bother clicking on the link..

My sweetiepie is the bestest. Last night I was in a pretty poopy mood, at least partially because I was short on sleep. This is my own fault, but he still turned on extra-lovable-mode and agreed to go out of the house and eat at <a href="http://www.cactusjacksworksop.co.uk/">Cactus Jack's</a> (is that site pretty well broken, or is it me?) and then go a nice long evening stroll. I need breaks from the routine and different things to stay ungrumpy, but for darren it's the opposite - he prefers relaxing in comfort to activity. So it was really nice of him to be willing to jump up at a moment's notice... 

Book wise, I've just finished re-reading <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/0441007961?ie=UTF8&tag=cat09-21&linkCode=as2&camp=1634&creative=19450&creativeASIN=0441007961">The Sword, the Ring, and the Chalice </a><img src="http://www.assoc-amazon.co.uk/e/ir?t=cat09-21&l=as2&o=2&a=0441007961" width="1" height="1" border="0" alt="" style="border:none !important; margin:0px !important;" /> trilogy. I did not love it. I didn't abhor it either, but I'd certainly not recommend it to anyone. Some of the worn out themes made me gag. Swords that were more inportant than anything else, including human life. Not being kingly because you're not good with a sword. True, true love and happily ever after. Fate: I must be king for the sole reason that my father was king, and despite the fact that I knew nothing of my heritage and would have happily lived as a blacksmith, this is the only right way for the world to progress. 

What to read now?  I'm wondering if maybe I should re-read the malazan ones.
