Well I've just bought I <a href="http://www.nokia.co.uk/A4344232">Noka N73</a>, which I should hopefully have on Wednesday May 16th. I've also bought a 1 gig mini-SD Card for it, with a card reader and an adaptor to make it work like a normal SD card, for only Â£13.... impressive, neh?

I'm hoping to use the phone for my <a href="http://www3.open.ac.uk/courses/bin/p12.dll?Q01C39">OU studies... </a> (currently TT282)... as they use a pile of PDFs as study guides, and I'll even be able to do research online while on the train because I've now got a contract with minutes and stuff...

The other thing *l* I sent an email to the mozilla store the other day... I was hoping without luck that whoever responded would have a sense of humour.....

10-May (1 day ago)
I will pass this to the relevant department and someone will contact you
if they can help.</mozillastore@merchandisemania.co.uk>

Thank you

Hello,

Just thought I should drop a quick note here - I'm female, and I think
it's a shame you don't have any feminine-sized tops in store. It's not
only guys who are geeks or want to put pictures of firefox on
themselves, but I'd really rather do it with a "babydoll" or more
formfitting style top. The "small" size is not really what I'm looking
for.

Otherwise the shop is great!

Just remember - there are hot she-geeks out there ;)</blockquote>
