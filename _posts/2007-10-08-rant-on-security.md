After having to change many many many passwords I have discovered how thoroughly IDIOTIC password requirements are. 

Natwest Online banking - less than 20 characters, no spaces or special characters allowed. While admittedly length is the single most important factor in password strength, special characters and spaces help. And I had wanted to use some. PLEASE, I know it's not hard to escape naughty characters, why can't the bank's programmers do that?

Open University - only 6-12 Characters allowed!!! I got so pissy trying to get a password they liked that I tried something like "fineisthisshortenoughforyou??" only of course it wasn't, so I had to try again. Why the hell only up to 12 - would 20, 30, or even 40 characters cause a buffer overflow??? I think not. 

Worst are some I won't mention specifically that require passwords of exactly a certain length with exactly this many digits and this many capitals and this many special characters. Make it REALLY easy for the hackers, why not, and rule out lots and lots of password combinations for them straight away by giving them the formula!!

Crazy password requirements mean you'll likely have to make passwords you won't remember to satisfy the picky password checker. That really doesn't help security either. It makes you a lot more likely to do a naughty naughty thing called Writing Passwords Down. 

Some password recommendations are something along the lines of more "one capital or more, one number or more, on special character or more, and at least X characters long". That's not too bad, but suggests that 1cecre@m is quite secure, which it's not particularly. ANY sensible password cracking scripts will look for obvious substitutes, so L337$93@K may not necessarily be any more secure than LEETSPEAK as a password. People tend to think hackers are really, really dumb. (Not saying some aren't, though).
