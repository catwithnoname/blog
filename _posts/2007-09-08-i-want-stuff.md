<a href="http://www.bushgear.co.uk/acatalog/Camping.html">A cool camping plate set!</a> You'll have to scroll down to see it. The sporks are pretty darn cool too. I think I want a set of the lime green (ya'll must have noticed I like lime green by now...) plus several sporks. Correction... I KNOW I want them. I just spent ages looking at cmaping/hiking/cycling stuff, but nothing calls my name like that set does. 
I also want <a href="http://www.ebuyer.com/customer/products/index.html?rb=0&action=c2hvd19wcm9kdWN0X292ZXJ2aWV3&product_uid=111757">these</a> (funnily enough, they're green, too...) but really they're nothing to do with walking or camping except that they're durable for people like me who are rough with stuff and are likely to drop them in mud or walk on them or something else crazy. 

I did quite a bit of overtime recently at work so I could have some more ready cash... So I'll be able to afford the random little things that I want... plus the money from the car crash which has started to come in blocks from mum, plus the money dad owes us for the CPU we bought for Ella a while back, and THEN I found out that first aiders get a one time Â£100 bonus, which I didn't get paid six months ago cos A) I didn't know about it and didn't chase it up at the time and B) for some reason the HR dept didn't know that three people had trained as first aiders in March. It was all nifty and felt like I was getting loads of goodness all at once. Darren's parents have decided to give us some money for no reason at all now. Is it crazy to say that it sucks? It makes it feel like the accomplishemnts I've had to work for (or in one case, break bones for,) are insignificant. I remember feeling the same way when I was 12 / 13 / 14 and I spent almost everyday after school and on weekends babysitting, saving up enough to buy myself things like a walkman, (remember using tapes? *lol*) a CD player, even my first PC... and my friends got the same stuff given to them for free. It made me feel like... what the hell am I working for? I guess I just really don't like handouts.
