I've been wanting the <a href="http://www.t-mobile.co.uk/shop/mobile-phones/phones/pay-monthly/t-mobile/g1-black/overview/?WT.mc_id=ON_QM_S_Google&WT.srch=1">G1</a> for what feels like ages and ages now, but can't be that long really, considering it was only released in October.  I would have it already, if not for being locked into a contract with my <a href="http://www.virginmobile.com/vm/viewProduct.do?productId=EA8D7F4B-706B-4C01-8D8B-9EB7A5041D2F">Sony Ericsson K850i</a> with Virgin Mobile. It's a good few months yet before the contract runs out, but I am growing weaker and weaker. Maybe, if I hold on until April, the <a href="http://www.htc.com/www/product/magic/overview.html">HTC Magic </a>will be out, supplied by <a href="http://shop.vodafone.co.uk/shop/mobile-phone/htc-magic?phoneView=ImageGallery">Vodafone</a>, and it might drive the G1's price down a bit. Note how on Vodafone's site they list one of the HTC Magic's features as "white", along with things like "touch screen", "handsfree headset" and "wifi". Does the white come inbuilt or separately in the box?
