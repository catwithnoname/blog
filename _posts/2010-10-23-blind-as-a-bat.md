Not really though. A month or three ago I had an eyetest, as it'd been a while since my last one, I'd been noticing some blurryness, and I have DEFINITELY been noticing headaches whilst driving or cycling for long periods of time. The test took a while longer than normal but I didn't click that he was struggling to match a glasses lense to my left eye - no lense fixed it properly. Glasses sure HELP, but not as well as they should do. 

A referral to the doctor ensued, followed by a referral to the ophthalmology department at a local hospital.  

At my first hospital appointment the lady I saw did some tests (including a nasty eye dilating drops thingy that made me unable to read for hours) and told me that she though I was probably afflicted with being a silly nervous girl (apparently flighty nervousness can actually make your prescription fluctuate), but possibly as overkill she was going to do one last test. We did the test, and then she came back and said, oh, actually it looks like you have <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Keratoconus">Keratoconus</a>, but we'll need the corneal specialist to confirm this. So to her initial diagnosis, snarky snarky nyeh. 

So you may ask what Keratoconus is and not have bothered to go to that wikipedia link up there... Basically my cornea is thinner than it should be and not shaped like the perfect lense it should be, with a "cone" area a normal eye wouldn't have. This of course means that light doesn't refract in the way a normal cornea would make it do, and why glasses can't fix it. It's usually treated by hard contact lenses, which will trap tears behind the lens and effectively make an artificial correctly shaped surface in front of the eye. Because the corneas aren't the right shape, normal soft lenses won't fix it as they'll just mold to the dodgy shape... but there are special soft lenses suitable for keratoconus too.

My next round of appointments didn't come for several weeks. First I saw the contact lense specialist at the hospital. He also told me it looked pretty clear that I had Keratoconus but needed to be officially diagnosed by the corneal specialist, and agreed with my original optician's difficulty to match a glasses lense to my right eye.  He says from experience he doesn't think that hard lenses will work too well for me, so well start out trying soft ones, after I've seen the corneal specialist.

Yesterday was the corneal specialist who made it clear that it wasn't even a question, and I definitely had it. I need to stop rubbing my eyes, because obviously rubbing thin rubbish corneas makes their shape warp further. He had good news, too. Since I was diagnosed in my 20s, relatively late, I probably would always have a mild case if I can stop rubbing my eyes. We pinpointed the fact that I'd never had hayfever problems of note til I came to the UK, which was also roughly when I started needing glasses. 

I've been given a list of drops, both ones to stop the itchy eyes (he said that even well out of hayfever season he could see irritation in my eyes) and drops to hydrate my eyes when needed. 

I'm waiting for the next appointment to get fitted with lenses now. I've been told to expect a new glasses prescription every 6 months or so (argh!!) for the times I can't wear lenses. I really hope that I'll be able to adapt to the lenses well. Dry eyes and itchy eyes do NOT make for easy wear.

I'm pretty happy with the way things went, really. Noticing a degenerative eye disorder while it's mild is much better than if I'd continued in my itchy hayfevered state until it was serious because I'd rubbed my eyes to bits. Not-rubbing is a real challenge, though. I do it so often without thinking, and often catch myself rubbing, but only AFTER I've started, and not before.

Aside: Lens, lense? Dictionary.com has entries for both, but lens looks like the more proper term. I'll say that in a reserved way because language is fluid and if lense is commonly in use and not terribly incorrect in some way, why not use it?
