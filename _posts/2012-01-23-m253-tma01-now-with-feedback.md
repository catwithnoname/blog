Ugh. Since the last post we've suffered through a whole TMA, submitted it, and gotten feedback on the team half. I guess the individual half of the TMA will come at some point later. 
We were awarded 31 out of a possible 50 points - equivalent to a mark of 62%. I have <em>never</em> had such a bad mark with the OU, and when I was reading the tutor's feedback I was amused to find I experienced the first few PVCs I've really noticed in months. So very clearly stress related, stupid heart.

I particularly thought the comments our tutor made about "rosy glow" to be interesting. The question he referred to was one that three other team mates worked on - and I spluttered and wondered if I'd done the same course as them, when I read their answer. It was indeed rose-tinted. We did everything so well and worked together perfectly! I decided not to post my real thoughts, because if they really were enjoying the course this much, who am I to piss all over their cake? Or whatever the saying is. It is reassuring to know that perhaps not everyone believed the happy rosiness. 

Fuckity fuckity fuck this course.
