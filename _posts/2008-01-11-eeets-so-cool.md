If you don't already know all about the <a href="http://www.ebuyer.com/product/135074">Eee</a>, now you will. It's a cross between an ultra-portable laptop and a PDA. It's got a seven inch screen, and it wights less than a kilo. It's only got between 2, 4 or 8 gb of storage space. "Why do you want a tiny laptop with no space?" you ask. "Well," I say, "it's good when on the go." Or if you just want to browse. Want to drop it? go on, it hasn't got a hard disk drive, it's got a solid state drive. That means that clunks don't ruin it. It has USB ports and an SD card reader, so the paltry few gigs of storage are easily expandable. It runs a dumbed down version of linux that anyone can use, so the OS doesn't take the space or require the performance that a windows machine does. and for people who don't need dumbed down-ness, you can pull the full OS functionality out with a bit of tinkering. If you must have windows, it comes with a guide on how to do that (I used to run Windows XP on a 4GB drive, not all that long ago. Weird to contemplate.) It can take a normal ethernet cable or pick up a wifi connection. 

If, let's say, you wanted a small device to take on the train to study with... or your spouse has expressed a wish in the past to be able to go to bed early AND YET continue to browse the internet... it might be useful.

I want. I really do. 

And this week was sucky, I didn't want to do overtime but had no big excuse not to, so I did a whole day. That's half the Eee paid for. I never did the walk from Bamford that I'd planned. (A quickie, only five miles or thereabouts, but I really want a chance to try out my GPS and do some geocaching!!!)

On a different sucky note, my main hard drive told me a few days ago that it was thinking about failing. I had two 80 gig Seagate Barracuda drives, which made figuring out WHICH one was failing a whee bit tricky. I was trying to download all sort of diagnostic tools... then I realised the easiest thing would be to unplug the data drive (one drive I used to store data, like photos and uni work, and the other drive I used for programs and my OSes) and see if I got a message about imminent drive failure coming up when I booted without that drive in... and I did. So my data drive is ok, and I don't need to spend ages backing it up, which is good. 

I browsed about and got a half-terabyte drive, which expanded my capacity greatly. It's quite amusing to see a 500 gig 7200 rpm drive going for the same price as a 36 gig 10,000 rpm drive. A wee bit of extra speed, slightly faster boot times and game loading times.... and over 450 gigs less space? naaaaaah! 

ATM I'm running linux and I just can't be bothered installing windows, although I know I need to for games and my webcam, which I couldn't get to work on linux last time. I shall eventually. Maybe even sunday?

Rereading Harry Potter and just about done. Harry Potter characters, stop dying!! *sad*

Oh yeah, I got a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Judogi">Gi</a>!! Well, kinda.... we have one between us, need to place the other one on order. Martial artsing is loooooooooaaaaaads of fun!!! we were doing all sorts of EVIL leg stretching yesterday, before practising kicks. I used to be able to do the splits so easily!! but all my leg musles wanted to snap partway down, thistime. I may have to try and limber up enough to do it again. Can I be bothered? I know not, but I would like to show improvement in the class.
