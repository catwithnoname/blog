I was really restless today. 

Darren offered to ride bikes so we did a quickie through to Shireoaks, and tasted some nice sweet blackberries and some ew-ew-ew-spit-it-out-now sour blackberries. I didn't really think it would be a good idea to go on a longer bikeride considering how much I'm doing atm already. 

Didn't feel like reading a lot cos <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/0552552119?ie=UTF8&tag=cat09-21&linkCode=as2&camp=1634&creative=6738&creativeASIN=0552552119">Eldest</a><img src="http://www.assoc-amazon.co.uk/e/ir?t=cat09-21&l=as2&o=2&a=0552552119" width="1" height="1" border="0" alt="" style="border:none !important; margin:0px !important;" /> isn't very enthralling (I only got about two pages into the shadow book before Darren bought me the second Eragon book so I gave it up...) and I didn't feel like 'putering. Our home network has been down for a while for no clear reason, but I blame windows update on Darren's PC cos both my linux and windows networks broke at the same time. 

Eventually I decided to get out to the garden and attack some weeds. There's the long fastgrowing thingy with white flowers that twines around everything that got serious attacked. I cut a big bunch of lavender, and another with lemon balm and rosemary. It's beside my PC now and occasionally I brush it to revive the scent. I'm hoping they'll dry out nicely. I think the lemon balm might get crumbly when it dries though. 

And the last thing is that I'm a really greedy person. I want a digital arts tablet, a desire revived by <a href="http://www.deviantart.com/deviation/25660523/?offset=10">this digital art tutorial</a>. But then I stop and think about how very very badly I want a new phone to replace my fizzed-in-the-rain one, and that I want loads more stuff besides, like more bikes (truly!) and a laptop and a PDA (although this cold come into the smartphone category and satisfy two desires with one stroke) and lots of books and well y'know... stuff. I think I might cancel my creditcard actually because I am so very very very tempted to use it for another phone but that's not what it's for, it's for ordering things overseas. I wish Maestro was more widely accepted. I'll just have to be strong I suppose *g*. And in a few years I'll be a big successful web developer or maybe even programmer, so I'll have lots of money to spend on stuff.
