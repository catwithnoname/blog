<a href="http://maps.google.co.uk/maps/ms?hl=en&ie=UTF8&msa=0&msid=106286149304644401199.00045754e8f300ea8c01c&t=h&z=9">I have a map</a> of where I'm staying on my biking trip. I have three reservations, a hostel with shared rooms the first night before I set off, and two nicer B & Bs for the last two nights.  It's cool seeing the little green men (on bikes - not aliens...) spanning across england.

Job wise, I'm feeling positive. I've applied for a huge pile of permanent sheffield-based jobs. If I get an interview I don't know what I need to do to get time off.... Wait & see I guess. I won't jump for any stupid position that I won't like, and I think I'll ask about at work to find out if there are any relevant positions related to web development. Probably not...
