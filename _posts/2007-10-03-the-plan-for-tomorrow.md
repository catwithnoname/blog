<a href="http://www.walkingbritain.co.uk/walks/walks/walk_b/3407/">Walk 3407</a> from walkingbritain.co.uk. I'll start off at Chinley, which has iffy associations for me, since that was where I got lost from the time when I got so majorly lost I ended up in a different town from the one I was headed to. This is going in a different direction however, towards Edale, which I know and love. 

I'm doing in tomorrow and not today cos I was doing work.... Fujitsu Siemens HBOS analysts have been visiting Computercall, the HBOS firstline people regularly. It's in Pudsey which is by Leeds, only an hour or so from Sheffield. And it's always on Wednesdays for some reason. The idea is bonding and learning and all that - I found it quite useful, actually. There's one thing I need to remember to pass on to colleagues that I learned... but never mind...

Reading <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/0349117624?ie=UTF8&tag=cat09-21&linkCode=as2&camp=1634&creative=6738&creativeASIN=0349117624">Jennifer Government</a><img src="http://www.assoc-amazon.co.uk/e/ir?t=cat09-21&l=as2&o=2&a=0349117624" width="1" height="1" border="0" alt="" style="border:none !important; margin:0px !important;" />, so far intrigued and enjoying. I know it's meant to speak to one lots and be a really think-ey book but I am just enjoying it for the story as well.
