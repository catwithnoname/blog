And bored. I'm sitting here looking like I'm working whilst we get filmed, people making speeches, etc.... I'm not at my normal desk, so I can't even get all my normal programs (needed to do real work) to load, but no one can really see my screen anyway...
It's some publicity thing going on for FSC in Germany I think. They needed volunteers so I said OK! I think working would have been more exciting though.
