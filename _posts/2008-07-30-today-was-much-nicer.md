I had a Depo appointment in the morning. I'm not scared of needles at all (remember I have 7 earrings?) but the illogical bit of me always makes me tense up a tiny bit anyway. The nurse today was sneaky in a good way and stuck me before I was ready, so I didn't have a chance to tense up. She did do it a bit higher than normal, so my waistband on my trousers is causing the stiff muscle some irritation. Oh well.

Henry, one of my team leaders, had asked on Tuesday if I wanted to do any overtime, but I rang in on Wednesday morning and said I didn't want to after all. Between the sucky asthma night and the night before when I'd biked to Harworth and back to fix a computer, I was feeling a bit low and a lot tired. 

At home after being needlestuck I spent a while playing <a href="http://www.xbox.com/en-US/games/h/hexic2xboxlivearcade/">Hexic 2</a> and then some <a href="http://www.xbox.com/en-US/games/b/bombermanlivexboxlivearcade/default.htm">Bomberman Live</a>. I managed to get the achievement for unlocking 60 costumes, finally. I downloaded some more costumes and was really disappointed to find out they didn't need to be unlocked!! What shall I strive for now? *lol*

Oooh, I think I can post my gamercard! Let's see:

Eventually my Bomberman patience ran out, and after a while reading, and a while on PC, I decided to go for a bikeride. I popped a Dragonlance book into my nice big waistbag, sprayed some grease on my big bike's chain, some air in its tyres, and off I went. 

The canal had lots of sun on it, so I enjoyed riding slowly and observing all the fish. There weren't too many fishermen to run over, either. I did notice one guy fishing who had possibly the strongest tan I've ever ever seen. It makes me feel a bit sick to think of it really. I can imagine the cancerous cells multiplying inside his skin right now. I genuinely had to check really carefully before I decided he was Caucasian. The main indicator apart from his european features was the fact that I could see the edge of the tan lines where his back met his folding chair. The darkest "white" guy I've ever seen, and he has a huge white chair-back shaped white spot on his back. Must look really weird when he stands up *l*.

I veered off along the cyclepath towards shireoaks marina and to the old colliery tip - which has been redone over the last few years to be a lovely woodland. The trees are all young, but not so small I couldn't plop down in the grass under one and enjoy reading my book in its shade. The sun, outdoors, and physical activity have such a marked effect on my mood. No wonder living in Baltimore closed up in a house and apartment with little to no exercise I was miserable. Even a day without outdoorsiness makes me antsy nowdays. I had to leave a bit earlier than I would have liked, since the long grass gave me many sneezes and a runny nose. I hate hayfever. I think hayfever should only be given to indoors people. That would be fairer. *nods*. My timing was just right and I arrived at Darren's work just as he was closing up, and escorted him home, walking the bike. 

As I said, a much better day. One of those days where I just say to myself... I'm content. I'm even happy. It's no trivial thing - I feel really lucky sometimes.
