On Saturday I got off the train early, cos I like to cycle. I stopped by Sainsbury's supermarket on the way to pick up some food. At the cycle parking area a boy of 10 or so - give or take a couple of years - came along and told me he liked my bike. That's the perfect pickup line for me, y'know. So I decided to show off a wee bit and show him how it folded. He was young and not <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chav">chav</a>-like so I didn't feel intimdated and unwilling to discuss my bike or its features lest it get damaged or stolen. A girl of similar age came along - perhaps a sister or friend - on her bike, and started to chat as well. She asked me if I'd fallen off my bike recently, noticing the graze on my knee. We chatted a little bit longer, and then I left and went to the supermarket to get food.

When I got home I mentioned the encounter to Darren. The kids were way nicer than most young people that I see around Worksop - many of them are intimidating and will be horrid to you if you dare even glance their way. I once looked at a girl for too long - apparently - whilst walking past her and got spat at, a coin thrown at me, and HER yelling at me and calling me a hooligan. A group that lives near us used to dawdle around in car parks on stolen bikes regularly (I know this because one of the bikes in question had belonged to me before it went walkies).... On the train some younger people seem to think that just because their mobile phone CAN play music on the speakerphone, it SHOULD be playing awful tinny music at all times. Rude? What, really? It's illegal? Why's that? I did actually overhear the train conductor in a conversation like that with a girl who was using her mp3 speakerphone thingy.... she seemed to be playing innocent, as though she honestly had no idea that playing your own music out loud in a public place might be unpleasant for others.

Most of the time, encounters with young people (by which I guess I mean mid teens or younger) are unpleasant. I'm not saying that most young people in Worksop and surrounding areas are horrid - I imagine that they just get themselves noticed less or they stay inside / are kept inside more than the rowdy variety.

So when one happens to encounter two young people who are actually inquisitive and nice, rather than rude or intimidating, one might remark upon it... no? *l* I was also suprised by their age - I don't tend to see many kids their age out and about on their own. I don't think that it's particularly negligent of parents to let kids out at their age - kids are smarter than a lot of parents give them credit for, I reckon, and they need to get some experience with life BEFORE they turn 18 and get turfed out to uni or work or whatever they wish to do. The only negligent thing I could see was the fact that the boy was obviously allowed to run around without a top on all summer and was deeply tanned, but considering the amount of tanning salons in Worksop, I guess a lot of parents don't even think that encouraging skin cancer in their child is negligence...

Remarking that I can like children if they aren't horrible, scary, rude, etc after having spoken quickly to two nice children in no way consitutes an announcment that I want to have kids anywhere in the imminent future *lmao* so stop reading into things!!
