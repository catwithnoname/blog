I think I fixed the contrast on the comms now but I haven't looked since I changed the stylesheet.

It appears to be cliche - full but in a pleasant way. I'm looking forward to the next book.

I broke my bike yesterday. Just after I'd left work for the day my chained jammed (while I was in a roundabout!) and I forced it out, but it warped the gear changing mechanism (don't ask me for technical terms here) so my front gears didn't change. It was still perfectly rideable, and if I'd really wanted I could have changed it manually, but then I would have lost the extra time a gearchange would have given me and also it's not a good idea to just randomly stop on the A57. I'd also have gotten my fingers greasy.

I tried to go to Halford's yesterday to get it fixed (I have a maintenance plan with them) but they shut at 6. I went in today and I think the repair took about 20 minutes in total, mostly forcing the mechanism back into shape with some pliers. They also fixed gear 8 on my rear set of cogs. I'd thought I only had seven cos on my front gear changer paddle thingy, the numbers go up to three but you can't change into three and there are clearly only two front gears when you look at the cogs. Number 8 on the back didn't work, I'd never really counted, I'll admit, but I assumed it was the same story. Apparently it was just wonky though cos now it does work.

I've got nasty hayfever and I think it might be egged on by the nasty smoke from next door. It seems to come through the floorboards from their house... we have a cupboard that's not carpeted in the corner, which seems to be the culprit. I hate snot.

Oh, and if you don't know about this wonderfulness, look at Colorjunction.

I have it as part of my iGoogle, and I can actually play it at work where all webgames are banned. niftyness, eh? (in my iGoogle I can get email previews too, even though I can't access gmail directly.)
