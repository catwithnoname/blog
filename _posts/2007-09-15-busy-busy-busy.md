I'm sitting at work eating some seeds. I can feel the omega 3 oils entering my system already. Or maybe they're just a nice snack. 

I'd hoped to do a post on wednesday after my walk. When I got home however (7 hours of walking, two blisters, and rings of  red allergic reaction to heather or some other moor-ey plant around my ankles) and wanted to collapse I found Darren was having problems attaching an LCD wall mount to the wall. He was doing this cos he's just spent Â£1400 on a nice new PC that should be top of the range-ish for a while. He was preparing the wall mount for his 22" widescreen tv (or is it 22'? You know I want to say inches, not feet. Why can't we all use metric? Why?????). 22 inches is just wicked and evil and nearly like a TV! 

We spent all evening doing that, and then the next day (night before last) after work we dedicated the evening to affixing shelving to the walls. He's taken down the shelving and CD racks and stuff that were build onto the desk,  and then we've bought some matching cherrywood-veneer boards which we affixed higher up on the wall. This has the dual advantage of allowing him more desk space and having a place to put stuff where the small mischiefmaker/hunter/climber/biter can't (or at least hasn't yet) climb. She'd have to go on top of the TV to do it, and she already knows she's not allowed there. It doesn't always stop her, but she's less likely to go onto a place that's forbidden *l*.

And then last night we were busy building the PC cos it had arrived!! It's all fancy, the biggest tower i've ever seen, possibly excepting server boxes. It was <i>supposed</i> to have been designed specifically for watercooling. We needed watercooling, cos the motherboard was so hot that it would overheat after a few seconds without it. Freaky. The watercooling basically consists of a radiator which the water is run through to cool it, a pump to move the water, and then attachments you'll have to join to any components that you want to cool. Tubing runs between each component, sealed with clippy things to prevent leakage. Because the components are quite large, the radiator is designed to go outside the case. This also allows more effective cooling. The case has holes for the tubing, cos it's that cool. BUT the tubing is 7/8" (again, I hope I'm not saying feet here *L*) and the holes are something like 1/2".... which is not good. So we had to get a drill bitty thing, which we will be using tonight.... and possibly masking tape or inulation tape to make the rough edges less so. 

I got my results for my last course in the post the other day.... another grade 2 pass. I was slightly annoyed it wasn't the top grade pass, but really as long as I passed it didn't matter - and I'd expected not to do as well as I might've if the trains and Darren's dad's ill health AND the holiday to israel hadn't confused issues. I was also comforted when I checked the details feedback online, and found out NO ONE from the 135 people who took the course managed to get top marks. They mostly had the same difficulties I had with the report element (I found the coding easy and fun!) where basically we were given two semi-incompatible sets of criteria for how to write it. Meshing the two together was confusing and not all easy and loooads of people complained on the forums about the incongruity, but the markers and course chair are always right, so what can you do? My books for the next course came along a week or three ago, and the MySQL book somehow migrated into the bathroom and gets portions of it read periodically. I'm really, really, really looking forward to this one, cos I should hopefullly get some proper learning about databases in. I learned the modicum of knowledge I have about them when I did the ECDL (as much as I disparage the ECDL, I didn't know much about Microsoft Access before I did it. Hold on... I still don't. Let me continue to disparage it and think bad thoughts about my ex-line-manager who claims to want people to grow but doesn't really mean it). 

Currently reading <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/1841492760?ie=UTF8&tag=cat09-21&linkCode=as2&camp=1634&creative=6738&creativeASIN=1841492760">Devices and Desires (Engineer Trilogy)</a><img src="http://www.assoc-amazon.co.uk/e/ir?t=cat09-21&l=as2&o=2&a=1841492760" width="1" height="1" border="0" alt="" style="border:none !important; margin:0px !important;" />. As I mentioned to Ulrica it's a bit disappointing that the first new book in a series has opening lines that are used in a different place in another book. I'd already decided that the style was formulaic. Not that the plots were similar in any way in the last two books, but she used similar pot devices and ideas.... mostly involiving "let's shock the reader with complete utter twistedness". I didn't expect so see such shocking opening lines though. Bah.

Oh yeah, the walk..... I'll have to do the story on that in a day or three when I can upload the pics.
