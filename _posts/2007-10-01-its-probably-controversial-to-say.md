... that testing on animals is a really really important thing, in some cases. Let me explain.

I bought some multi purpose cleaner from Tesco, from their "<a href="http://www.woodland-trust.org.uk/naturally/naturally_small.jpg">Naturally</a>" range. It's the sort of thing that people probably buy not because it's cheap or smells good or cleans well, but in the hopes that it's less environment harming than other household cleaning products. 

It says clearly on the back "<em>not tested on animals</em>".

Now, as just mentioned earlier, I'm probably buying this because I don't want to harm the environment. Animals are part of the environment, not just plants. If it's not been tested on animals, how do I know if it's going to harm them or not?

Surely the best thing would be to test it on a few animals, to learn if it's harmful or not. That's a lot less animals than if something was really harmful, distributed to thousands or millions of households, and unleashed upon the world without testing. 

A better thing on the back would be "<em>designed not to harm animals</em>". And I hope they made it all out of ingredients they *know* don't harm animals, cos otherwise not testing on animals is just cruel and horrible.
