And I can't put them down. It's almost physically impossible. I swapped my lunch hour with John today so that I could read an hour earlier than I would have otherwise *lol*. I need to get her Paksenarrion stuff so I can reread it. Mmmm mmm mmm. Why do good authors have to have a finite amount of books? No fair!!! 

And hey looksee!! <a href="http://books.google.co.uk/">books.google.co.uk</a>. I shall have to remember to look at that in further depth, it looks handy!! (Don't type Elizabeth Moon in there unless you want to see a selection of DREADFUL looking covers *lol* I think it's a Baen thing).

I'm listening to Katie Melua. 'sgood. 

We bought some USB hubs a few days ago, and they came today. I now have 4 usb ports accessible directly on top of my desk rather than having to mess with cables under my desk. (And my job is to make people mess with cables, so I know it's definitely a pain... so many people revert to rude morons when we ask them to do that. If someone wasn't comfortable unplugging something I'd probably not argue, unless they'd said they were worried it was dangerous, which many people do. If they did that, I'd tell them I'd not ask them to do it if it wasn't safe. And then I'd press no more. But all too often they'll do things like tell me "the engineer should be doing that, not me, it's what they're paid for!". They obviously know about the contract between us and the bank better than I do, despite this being my job.... Or "I'm not a technician, I can't go fitting cables. I don't know where they go anyway!!" When they were kids, they played with the toy where they slotted the circle into the circle shaped hole, and the star into the star shaped hole.... but they've lost this difficult skill as adults. )

I'm going to play <a href="http://www.khet.com/">Khet</a> now.
