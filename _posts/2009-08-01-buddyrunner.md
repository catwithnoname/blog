<a href="http://www.buddyrunner.com/yochannah"> Buddy runner</a> is an interesting Android app I've been playing with the last few days. Just another record-where-I'm-going sort of app that's popular in GPS phones. I used it 2 - 3 times when I originally got my phone, but decided to stop bothering since it cut my journeys off partway each time, for no apparent reason. I gave it a go again a few days ago, aiming to time my journeys into work and back, which might give me the drive to make it faster and more intense. It seems to have an "are you sure you want to stop recording?" dialogue now, which makes the app actually useful. 

Disappointingly, I've found that my ride to work is far shorter than I thought!!  Rather than 3.7 miles each way, it appears to be about 2.5. Over a mile each way lost? This terrible discovery is almost as bad as when they told me there were only 8 planets. Bastards for stealing Pluto and miles from me! 

It's not nearly as reliable as a dedicated sports device. Consider that the three journeys on July 30, 31, and Aug 1 started at the train station and ended at the bike stand at work, but the ascent I made on those three journeys reportedly varies from 144 feet to 209 feet. I'll never be using it for any long journeys, but it's nice to use on the shorter journeys when my phone'll be coming with me for sure, but I'd not normally bother to take a GPS. Now I just need to hope they'll make a <a href="http://www.cooloud.com/">BuddyCycler</a>, so it stops talking nonsense about all the calories I burnt on my 'run' (heck, it thinks I can run for a sustained period of time at 10+ miles per hour!).
