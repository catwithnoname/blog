Short summary: Woman is sentenced after making a video involving doing nasty booger things to Dominos food. The Consumerist points you to the local <a href="http://law.onecle.com/north-carolina/14-criminal-law/14-401.11.html">statute</a> which says:
<blockquote> "(a) It shall be unlawful for any person to knowingly distribute, sell, give away or otherwise cause to be placed in a position of human accessibility, any food or eatable substance which that person knows to contain:

(1) Any noxious or deleterious substance, material or article which might be injurious to a person's health or might cause a person any physical discomfort,"</blockquote>

Does that make it illegal to sell food with chillis (discomfort) or foods people may be allergic to? I'm not fussed enough to read through the other statutes to se if there are exceptions....
