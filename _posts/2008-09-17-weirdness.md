I still need to hash out the details of exactly where I'm staying at night on the c2c, and I need to order train tickets. Pre-order makes them about 1/4 of the price they would be if I bought them on the day, which is a crazy difference, really. I had some fun getting hold of a map - I tried to buy a map and guide from <a href="http://www.baytreepress.com/shop/Main_home">Baytree Press</a>, and I had a bit of a fit when the guide arrived, with no map. Turns out, once I'd calmed down enough to read the note that came with the guide, that the map was sold out and being reprinted, so probably really hard to get anywhere. It was due back in stock in the start of October.... And when did I plan my journey? Oct 2 - Oct 4... 

I know I have navigated without a proper map in the past, on walks and bike rides, but I still don't think it's a good idea. I rang the guy who both wrote the guide and owns Baytree, and eventually negotiated him sending me out a used map. It's very slightly dirty but otherwise in good condition, so I'm perfectly happy. 

And the weird thing... a possible <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/business/7621151.stm">HBOS / Lloyds TSB</a> merger (two big UK banks). I currently work for Fujitsu Siemens doing second line tech support for HBOS. We also currently do tech support for Lloyds, but Lloyds have recently chosen to go with a different supplier, and not Fujitsu Siemens, so in a few weeks we won't be dealing with Lloyds at all. What happens to my job if they merge? No one knows. I guess I'll find out more at work tomorrow...
