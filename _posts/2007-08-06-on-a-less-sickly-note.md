I had such a cool dream!! I think it's to do with the fact that we started watching <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/B00007LZ6H?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=cat09-21&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1634&amp;creative=6738&amp;creativeASIN=B00007LZ6H">Dark Angel</a><img src="http://www.assoc-amazon.co.uk/e/ir?t=cat09-21&amp;l=as2&amp;o=2&amp;a=B00007LZ6H" style="border: medium none  ! important; margin: 0px ! important" border="0" height="1" width="1" /> last night. I dreamed I was a trainee elite kid space-solider (Tony at work laughed at me when I said space soldier!!). During a training walk with two instructors we were practising how to walk in our special suits, boots, and mouthguards. (I hated the mouthguard cos it was really uncomfortable, and took it out at one point to see a bleeding gum. The guard was so big my lips stuck out, kinda like some kids who have / need braces do when they have protruding teeth. ) At one point during the walk the male mentor / instructor guy suddenly asked "where's (somekid'snameIdon'tremember)??" and we realised he'd been killed / abducted and the other mentor / instructor person hissed "Run!!!!!!" so we all ran as fast as we could towards the spacepad where we could launch off. On the way we passed spilled medicines and a dead nurse (cos all good elite spacesoldier people need to be on a steady diet of drugs, y'know). Normally there was rigid control at the exit towards the spacepad, but we prettymuch barged through and on the way ripped all the identifying marks and insignias off our uniforms, then formed up a line to board the spaceship. I knew at this point I was dreaming cos I decided to open my eyes and see what time it was, to know if I had enough time to continue this cool dream. Curse you, brain! it made me wake up for good and I couldn't get back to it. I really wanted to launch and be vengeful fugitive spacesoldier kids.

I wanna be a space soldier now.....
