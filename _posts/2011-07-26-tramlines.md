As I'm sure you'll know due to my extensive facebooking and tweeting of the fact, I attended <a href="http://www.tramlines.org.uk/">Tramlines</a> to sell <a href="http://folksy.com/shops/yochannah">my handmade jewellery</a>. 

The fee was more than most markets on that street are, and when I discussed it with Phil from Exposed magazine, who was organising the market stalls for the event, he stated that due to the high footfall (150,000+ people) it was reasonable to charge a higher fee. Fair enough...

Comes the day, I find the car park where the even is at about 8am, set up my stall beside a lovely friendly lady selling mostly handmade bags, as well as some other fabric/textiley things. And I wait. And wait. And wait. As do all of the other stallholders in the carpark. We can hear the music, we can see the people walking down the street, just over there.... but they're all walking down Eldon Street and not bothering with Eldon Street carpark. 

3pm, once we'd been there for about 7 hours, some Tramlines staff come along, and say we've been authorised to move the market on to the street (it was blocked off, so cars couldn't use it) but only until 9pm, rather than 11pm as originally promised. It took nearly an hour to move and set everything back up again - the stalls had to be dismantled, merchandise packed away, then I had to rope some staff into moving the stall, since I was on my own and couldn't carry a 3x1 meter steel and wooden stall on my own! Then there's trying to set everything back up in the horrid wind.... argh.

The stallholder beside me didn't bother to even move her stall, she just went home.

Once I'd gotten set up on the street, sales started to pour in! well, not quite pouring, but I'm pretty confident that I wouldn't have made a yucky smelly loss, if only I'd not been mis-sold the footfall and lost the larger portion of the first day. I've tried to add <a href="http://uk.linkedin.com/pub/dave-healy/7/888/964">Dave Healy, the Tramlines Director</a> as a contact on LinkedIn in hopes I'll be able to discuss the messup. I'll give him a day or two and then try other avenues if need be. 

On the positive note: I bought up lots of beads before the festival, specifically to make some of <a href="http://folksy.com/items/1848681-Glass-Drop-Necklace-Frozen-Lei?shop=yes">these necklaces</a>, in leads of different colours. On the second day I was making them as fast as I could between customers, which admittedly wasn't terribly fast - but I ran out of beads and nearly sold out of the necklaces. Niiiiiice. Bulk order of those beads coming up, kthx!
