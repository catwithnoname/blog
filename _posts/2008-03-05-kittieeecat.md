She has a bizarre affection for my Eee neoprene case, for some reason. She keeps on hopping onto my desk to sit on it (and sometimes gives me a hug as well).

That was taken with my Eee;s inbuilt cam. She's also sitting on my next assignment. How can I do an assignment when my cat's sitting on it?

The only disadvantage to her fondness for my desk is sometimes she seems to sit down with her bum pointing right in my face. As good as she smells when you sniff her fur, catbum just isn't my favourite bouquet... 

Non cat things: working another six day week this week, was late back from work on monday due to some training in Bracknell (3-4 hours south, nearish to London). I'll be able to afford my citizenship in no time.

(watch this space. I may be doing an exciting thing in June, but I don't plan to blog about it until I know one way or another.)
