It all seemsto be okayish now. There's still more to add, but the basic blueandgreen is working and not all wonky. I need to remember that the comments.php does not need any structural info, just the single post page. Next stylesheet switch when I'm struggling, I hope I'll remember that.

We went to York today, and <a href="http://www.jorvik-viking-centre.co.uk/index2.htm">Jorvik Viking centre</a>. It's a pretty nifty place, all in all. It starts off with a ride in a "time machine", which was silly but amusing, taking us back to the 9th and 10th centuries, and follows on with a ride through the town Jorvik (York) as it was then. I didn't really expect all the ridey stuff, but it wasn't bad. They tried to include authentic townsmell which was originally unpleasant, but after a moment or three I got used to it, and really it was not worse than a nowdays town with carstink, just different. Sometimes the stink from cars bothers me a lot, particularly in areas where no one is normally outside their car, so they don't really experience the smell, but I, on my bike, do. It's probably worse than the viking smell *l*. After the ride we did encounter the museum bit, which was what I had expected. That was really, really good. Darren got a silver coin struck (which we lost) and we saw lots of human bones.

(mum's on the phone now, will continue later)

(three minutes later) ..... okay it appears I''ll talk to them tomorrow in the end. 

I was about to talk about the bones. We saw quite a few bones with various causes of injury / death. some I could identify on my own, like a very badly mis-healed fracture. One thing that I had thought might be a tumour (although come to think of it, aren't tumours soft tissue that would not survive 1000 years under the ground? *L*) was actually some sort of horrible extra growth on the side of someone's face that was entirely bone, almost the size of my fist. There were several skulls, with fractures and punctures and cuts. Hip bones and ribs with cuts and nicks and slices and holes. A cut that had slice a long sliver from the side of the bone made me shiver quite a bit. To cut off that much bone would have involved cutting a long flap of armflesh. Seeing -real- wounds like that makes battle so much more chilling.

I think the most chilling bit of all was to understand that there were human bones. Inside those skulls there used to be brains, and those brains made a person just like me who walked and talked and ate and smiled. They had a real life, hopefully a happy one. But now inside their skull there was only plastic to hold it up on the stand. It was kind of unreal and very hard to understand. But it made me wonder if maybe in a thousand years (they're pretty sure at least one of these guys died in 1066, nearly 1000 years ago....)  my brainmatter would be all outside my skull with plastic (or something futuristically equivalent) in there instead. They might be using clues from my remains to think what life was like now, and shudder at the primitive smells and foods and dwellings we had. They might carbon date me and try to find out where I was born and where I grew up (freakishly hard to determine with me!! *L*) and how I died. I wouldn't mind. But mostly I tried to really, really imagine those bones being upright and part of a person. Did he have a beard? What colour hair did he have? Did he have a family? I'm sure he never thought his bones, his life, and his death, could be so significant to people today.... weird musings.

We bought a horn cup at the shop, a piece of antler, and a viking game. It's a strategy game where the king in the middle, defended by his 12 helpers, has to get to the edge of the board to win. The 24 people at the edges have to win by boxing the king in and preventing him getting to the edge. We played it once, but I can see it'll be fun (more than say, connect four, or checkers, but without the difficult complexity of chess...)

I bought a hat in town, so no more sunburn on walks, I hope. 

We went to the museum as well, but we only entered at about 4pm, and as it closes at about 5 we didn't get nearly enough time. we took a few quick looks at the viking and anglo saxon stuff, including a high quality sword and helmet. Iron is very truly black when it is old and pitted and corroded. The fee to get in was Â£5 each, which is not expensive in itself, but considering that the ticket is good for a year, it's utterly amazing. We will be back, probably to spend a whole day just on the museum, as it harboured much stuff that we would love to see and look at properly (and not fleetingly while heading to the door). 

Hopefully we will go in the train next time so I won't feel really sick on the journey... or at least, I might drive soonish, which will make the sickness non-existent I think. I still don't know how I feel about actually using the car for destinations I can reach easily on the train though. I feel like I shouldn't, but I have another person's opinion to listen to as well, and I think he might prefer the car. Hmmm.
