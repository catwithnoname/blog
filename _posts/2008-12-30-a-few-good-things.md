Let's be positive. 

Darren's dad was moved to CCU (coronary care unit) a couple of nights ago. This is a step healthier than Intensive Care! 

I passed grading and gained my yellow belt a couple of weeks ago. Lots of sweat and exhaustion involved. I slept all afternoon afterwards. 

And I just got an assignment back in which I got 100%, even though I was missing some "this" recievers for my methods (the code worked without them, you see...)

We have some <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miracle_fruit">miracle fruit</a> tablets to try tonight, maybe.
