We had rain forecast for prettymuch the whole week, and I think we were kept off the dig site almost all day on Tuesday. If I recall correctly we started the day by washing finds. All finds that are found are put into a labelled tray whilst still muddy. With the help of bowls of water, toothbrushes, long sticks, etc, we cleaned mud off of the various shards of animal bone, pottery, building material, and oystershell in some of these boxes. I had the dubious privelige of getting a huge cow jawbone to clean - it's not exactly every day you have the chance to grab a toothbrush and brush a cow's teeth, let alone one that's been dead for hundreds of years.... Oystershell was very difficult to clean without ruining it - it was very flaky. 

After teabreak - they were hilariously religious about taking their breaks - we strolled over to a different building nearby and had a lecture on small finds. "Small finds" differ from "finds" basically cos they're more interesting - things like coins, metal, glass, worked bone, etc.  We got divided into groups and had finds passed about among us, which we had to try to identify or guess the purpose of. My group was given a slightly evil one to identify - a "<a href="http://www.jorvik-viking-centre.co.uk/hungate/abouthungate/find19.htm">bone socketed point</a>" that no one knows the purpose of. We guessed it might be to do with threading or making rope.... We also got a <a href="http://www.jorvik-viking-centre.co.uk/hungate/abouthungate/find7.htm">ceramic toy</a> - when I was in NZ we used to call the game knucklebones, in israel its name would roughly translate to "five stones", and I've seen it called jacks (which involves a ball, knucklebones doesn't) as well, but I'm not sure if that's primarily an american thing? 

Darren's group got <a href="http://www.jorvik-viking-centre.co.uk/hungate/abouthungate/find10.htm">pins and a pinner's bone</a>, which were very difficult to identify. His group also got another weird thing - <a href="http://www.jorvik-viking-centre.co.uk/hungate/abouthungate/find15.htm">ceramic wig curlers</a>, which they couldn't identify either. About the only thing that they got that was easy to identify was a bone domino.

Others things given to various groups were a bit of bone that had been used as an ice skate, tips of antler that weren't used for anything - scrap ends, basically. There was some gorgeous glass - which goes opaque and shiny as it degrades. It didn't look at all like glass as we normally know it, but it was very pretty. 

After the lecture and lunch we were put on residue sorting. Soil samples from the site are taken, put in a sieve, and jet washed. Some of it's put in the 5 mm sieve - so small stuff washes out - and some is put in a 1 mm sieve - meaning prettymuch only the dirt is washed out, and loads of utterly TINY things have to be sorted with tweezers. All the big bits had been sorted out by the time we sat down with the trays. I don't recall the categories we sorted very well... possibly there was oranic matter (charcoal, small dried bits of cess, seeds, etc), bone, shell, small finds, and stone. Most of the stuff I sorted was uninteresting and fell easily into one of theose categories. Two things of note that I found was part of a bead - something pale and yellowish, like a bone or bit of ivory, I guess, and a bit of a fossil that looked kind of like a thin bead. Archaeologists don't care about fossils, apparently. They like old but not <em>that</em> old. *L* One of the sorters suggested that I might have found a bit of <a href="http://farm.brentnorris.net/farmpics02/4-18-07-2.jpg">crinoid</a>. That appears possible, but if it was part of a crinoid, it was only a single tiny disc. Darren found a fleck of green (presumably metal) that several archaeologists ummed and ahhed about, and ended up taking it to the head guy, Toby. He took it, pointed over to a wall somewhere, saying "look over there!" and whilst everyone as distracted he threw the anonymous green speck up into the air, to be lost forever. Poor Darren *l*. Apparently it was too utterly tiny to draw any conclusions or evidence from.  

The sun decided to show its face after all, so after the afternoon tea break we did make it out to site. We loves the mud, we do. This time we got to work on the area we'd work on for the rest of the week that had been too wet and dangerous on monday. Some of the water-filled holes are very deep - old wells, for example - so you really DO need to exercise care around them. We just had time to start cleaning the ground before we got rained off the site again. I was quite please to notice some strange dark circles cut into the reddish soil I was cleaning. When I pointed one ofthem out to Ben (a trained archaeologist, who supervises the placements who supervise us) he said they looked like stake holes, and that he's not noticed them before. I was delighted to discover a stake hole all by myself on my second day!! I even have <a href="http://picasaweb.google.co.uk/yochannah/HungateOurPhotos/photo#5238192755171516274">a pic of it</a>. 

The rain only made us leave site a few minutes before closing time so there wasn't really any time to start anything else before the end of the day. We walked aout town a bit, bought me another book to read, (<a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/redirect.html?ie=UTF8&location=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.co.uk%2FExcession-Iain-M-Banks%2Fdp%2F185723457X%3Fie%3DUTF8%26s%3Dbooks%26qid%3D1219684216%26sr%3D8-1&tag=cat09-21&linkCode=ur2&camp=1634&creative=6738">Excession: Ian M.

Then we picked up some sandwiches at M & S and went home, prettymuch spending the whole evening in our room lazing about and watching aliens abduct people.
