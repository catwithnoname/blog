And why do cats have to climb? It's a rule. I know no cats that don't have to climb to the highest shelf in the bookcase. This always has a predictable result.

 - Cat tries a precarious foothold and crashes to the floor to the amusement of its human.
 - Cat tries a precarious foothold and <em>doesn't</em> crash to the floor, to the astonishment of the human it deigns to live with. How the hell did the cat manage to get up there???
 - Human realises that precious belongings are at risk from cats who don't mind knocking things... or who enjoy knocking possessions off the shelf. Seldom do they worry about the cat - cats are experts at falling.

Our wicked beastie loves climbing onto high shelves and pretending that she's actually an item that belongs in the shelf, by sitting very, very still... it can take quite a long "spot the cat" session to find her. Wickedness. And yet so cute!!


I had the flu vaccination yesterday. (I detest the term flu jab for some reason...) The site where I was injected had gone hard and red and noticeably hotter than the rest of my arm, which is always cold. All of me is always cold... NHS direct says that anything apart from a fever and tenderness is very rare. Should I be concerned? Mum didn't answer when I tried to contact her earlier. I always feel bad contacting her with a health problem as my primary motivation... as opposed to, y'know, just to talk to family. Doesn't stop me though *lol*. 

I hope it's normal tomorrow.
