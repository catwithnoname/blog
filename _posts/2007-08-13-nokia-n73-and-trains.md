It's like a whole new Era. The trains are back, which mean I'll be less exhausted and home more. It felt bizzarely momentous when I realised I'd biked home from sheffield for the last time. I liked it a wee bit cos of the fitness but the sleeping, regulated diet, and lack of time were frustrating. 

Then a night or three ago when I got home a phone started to ring on my desk. It was a Nokia N73 Music edition. My previous one had gotten wet and drowned to death in a crappy raincoat, but because it was in a raincoat I didn't realise it was getting wet or ruined til I got home and it didn't work. I was utterly bummed and was using a really old phone that didn't old charge very well. Darren must have noticed just how much it had bothered me (I'm a bit ashamed to have moped so much about a phone, but it had a camera that was VERY high quality, an MP3 player, a proper XHTML web browser, PDA functions... need I go on?) and he got a used one from Ebay that was in very good condition. He's truly the bestest in the world. I love you very much, honey. (question is, will he read this? *l*)
