I submitted the little bastard, Enigma Machines and all the rest. Now I have a couple of weeks to do nuffink, and then I'll go back to the grind of studying, I guess. One more TMA to submit, one more day school in Nottingham (if I can get someone to cover that day at work since Mat bailed on me) then the exam in June. I find the marking requirements disappointly low... I have to get 40% on the exam component and 40% or more on the 4 TMAs (Teacher Marked Assignments) to pass the course. I'd already passed the assignment bit after submitting the first two assignments... makes one almost wonder why I'd even bother to submit the last two. I shall anyway, though, cos I'm Yochannah, and low grades make me cry.  

Then I have a few months off, which is too long, really. I think that the next presentation of <a href="http://www3.open.ac.uk/courses/bin/p12.dll?C01M257">M257</a> starts in October. I don't need summer holidays - I'd rather have a degree sooner. It'll be years otherwise, because I can't really afford to study more than one course at once. More importantly, I don't WANT to study lots of courses at once whilst I work full time, spend two evenings week at martial arts, and occasionally try and fit fun things into my life besides. It's been months since I've been on a real walk....  *sad face* and I have this wonderful idea in my brain to do with walking, which I can't flesh out without... walking! It would basically be Yet Another Walking Website, but focused on the Peak District area, for those who wish to get about on public transport. Something like <a href="http://uk.geocities.com/stationtostop/walks.html">Station to Stop</a> but less green and more up to date. I have a little waterproof pad for making important notes, and I lurb to take pics when I walk, which is all I think I'll really need. I blog most of my walks, and whilst blogstyle is not the same as instructions to do the walk if you've never done it, it's pretty good. I'd even try and throw in the geocaches on the way. I'm excited! I want to do this! But it won't be this week, probably, because I need to see the doc about a mole that is bigger than it used to be. Eeek. That's if I can get an appointment for Wednesday.

A Good Thing is that summer is coming back, of course. I'll be able to do stuff in the light after work!!!!!!! Almost every single day for the last couple of weeks I've gotten excited when I've seen how light it is on the way home. Buds on the trees and flowers poking up out of the ground.... Makes me want to squeak excitedly. I'm good at squeaking. I've gotten of the train at earlier stops a few times already and cycled the rest of the way home along the canal. When do the ducklings and cygnets and other cute mini waterfowl start showing up?
