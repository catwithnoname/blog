The week was sneaking by far too quickly for my liking. We went out to the dig site and started to record and then dig out <a href="http://picasaweb.google.com/yochannah/HungateOurPhotos/photo#5238191836606998034">this feature</a>. What you see in the pic is actually what was left after we removed it. It was a strange area of greyish clay with small flecks of charcoal in it. It was actually virtually empty of anything interesting - small bits of bone were found but only at the edges where it blended with other features. 

After the morning tea break we took our muddy boots off and headed towards the clean offices about 4 or 5 minutes away for our pottery lecture. We got shown selections of pottery - there was quite a lot of pre-historic stuff at the laboratory from a different dig. Prehistoric pottery's main feature is its crappyness - it generally looks like caked mud, or dog biscuits... we then progressed forwards through time, looking at roman pottery, of which my favourite has to be <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Samian_ware">Samian ware</a>. It's smooth and pretty and a lot nicer than most modern stuff in my opinion... *l* After the Roman period pottery goes all nasty and crappy again, and slowly techniques get rediscovered and pottery nicer. There's loads of stuff covered in various green glazes that were apparently lovely and poisonous - containing lead, for example. 

We got to hand around a lot of ancient and invaluable pottery. I couldn't help but imagine some ancient and nearly whole bit of pottery smashing on the floor and being ruined. I didn't feel un-clumsy enough to be trusted with that sort of thing really *l*. At work under my desk (and it's not only me, I do feel obliged to point out) there are quite a few large suspiciously coffee coloured stains... I'm not sure who's done more, me or Henry my team leader. Once when Adam spilled his coffee he actually said "oops, I've done a Yo". So... as I was saying, I'm not the most sure-handed of people. I didn't break anything this time though. 

After the pottery lecture and lunch we had to do loads more recording. The dimensions of the feature we'd excavated had to be recorded against the grid the site had been divided into with the help of lots of measuring tapes and a plum-bob. The plans were filled out with <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hachure">hachures</a> to indicate the slopes and gradients of the cut. (I had to look for the correct spelling of hachure for ages). We photographed it with the red and white pole thingy for a scale, and we used levels to record how high the various bits of it were. 

We did a training experiment with the levels first of all to make sure we'd not record rubbish, which took prettymuch all afternoon, but we were please to find we were pretty accurate at the end of the exercise. After that it was time to go back to our accommodation already! We sere lazy and spent most of the evening in our rooms. I nipped out to the laundrette to do some laundry and was lucky enough to get caught in an astounding downpour. I ran the short distance from the laundrette to our room but still managed to get quite soaked.
