... but people kept on kidnapping me and keeping me prisoner. I'd then have to break free and steal more supplies to finish the ride. All in all, this dream action made it a restless night and very hard to sleep.

I had a fun little encounter yesterday on the way home. I'd been having a nightmare with inner tubes encountering bits of metal on the road recently, so currently the only bike that is all together and running without punctures is my big bike. It's not a problem to take it on the early train in the morning, especially since one of the bike riders has broken his thumb in two places so can't ride at the moment, but taking it home will be more of a challenge since the late train's normally full of commuters. Since I finished half an hour earlier on Saturday than I do on weekdays, I decided I'd have time to cycle all the way home, neatly giving me exercise, enjoyment, and avoiding a possibly full train. 

A lady decided to try to run me over this time. I was crossing what is probably the most dangerous are of the whole journey, which I'm well aware of. There's an exit from <a href="http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?hl=en&ie=UTF8&ll=53.36241,-1.282429&spn=0.003105,0.009656&t=h&z=17">this roundabout</a> onto the M1, and logically people speed up to merge with the motorway. I'm following the A57 all the way from Sheffield to Worksop, so I have to pass in front of the M1 exit. For a car this is less of a problem, because they go quite quickly and wouldn't encounter other cars coming up behind them. As a cyclist, I am slower, and even if the roundabout is completely empty when I go onto it, a car can come up behind me and try to murder me. 

The roundabout was empty when I'd exited onto it, and I'd signalled right as soon as I went out on to the roundabout to make it clear that despite being in the left lane I wasn't going to use the first left exit. As I was partway across the exit I heard beeping so swerved left to the side of the sliproad. Moments later a car zoomed in behind me, and <em>stopped</em> to yell at me. I admired the hypocrisy of trying to tell me off for blocking an exit when she was blocking the exit far more efficiently herself by parking a whole car in it. She told me I was a fucking idiot, and to my surprise I yelled back that I'd fucking indicated that I would be covering the exit (so she should have had plenty of time to prepare and be careful not to run over me). A tiny voice in my head was astounded that the first words I said to strangers involved yelling loud and swearing. It's not that I dislike swearing, it's just that I tend to reserve it for people I know who I'm comfortable won't take offence. The lady told me I hadn't indicated, but I'm guessing it's more likely that she simply hadn't bothered to be observant. She said (yelled) something - I have no idea what the words were because I was too busy being angry - and I lost my temper some more, so told (yelled at) her I didn't want to talk to her, and that she should just go away. Thankfully she obliged. 

I turned to the dogwalkers who were just behind me and had witnessed the whole episode themselves. They were kind enough to reaffirm my faith in myself - they'd seen me indicate by sticking my right arm out, they thought the other lady was in the wrong and I was in the right. As soon as the fateful exit had cleared again, I crossed it once more, this time without event, and continued on home. I was slightly amused to notice that my anger made the next hill ascent far easier than normal. 

Cyclists are not legally allowed to cycle on pavement. They must cycle on roads, and they're allowed to take the left lane in a roundabout (non UK people, remember in the UK we drive on the wrong side so this is all reversed!!). The <a href="http://www.direct.gov.uk/en/TravelAndTransport/Highwaycode/DG_069837">Highway Code</a> confirms this. I hate how car drivers seem to think they have the right of way. 

On a less angry note: I like officially like Arthur C. Clarke and Frederick Pohl now. I've just read their <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/0007289987?ie=UTF8&tag=cat09-21&linkCode=as2&camp=1634&creative=6738&creativeASIN=0007289987">The Last Theorem</a><img src="http://www.assoc-amazon.co.uk/e/ir?t=cat09-21&l=as2&o=2&a=0007289987" width="1" height="1" border="0" alt="" style="border:none !important; margin:0px !important;" />. And I'm too late as usual, because Arthur C Clarke went and died earlier this year. Bah. 

The Last Theorem was great. It was full of mathematics, but <em>not</em> in a way that would bore me - and I dislike maths in general. They intentionally kept it simple, so as long as you got as far as Pythagorean Theorem in school. It felt a lot like the Shadow series by Orson Scott Card, with a world not too far off now, world development and politics that are believable, and bits of science and aliens thrown in.
