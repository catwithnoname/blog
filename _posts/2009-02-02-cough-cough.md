I have a cold :( walking to the toilet or moving across the bed is enough to set me off on a coughing fit... so this morning I decided perhaps it might be a bit deathly to attempt to bike to work in a snowstorm. It's been coming down all day, even in worksop, which is crazy!!

So I'm stuck in bed now, reading book and sleeping and coughing. I had a shower earlier and decided to use the menthol head and shoulders which i hate (it leaves a burning sensation on my scalp). It seems to have cleared up my nose a bit, and the scalp heat subsided eventually. 

The snow is so pretty! why do I have to be too sick to go out in it, dammit? the most I can do is open the door and laugh as the cat stares at the suspicious white stuff.... 

Edit: I never knew I was so typical: <a href="http://news.sky.com/skynews/Home/UK-News/Credit-Crunch-Blues-More-Brits-To-Take-Sickies-on-Monday-Than-Any-Other-Day/Article/200902115214803?lpos=UK_News_News_Your_Way_Region_4&lid=NewsYourWay_ARTICLE_15214803_Credit_Crunch_Blues%3A_More_Brits_To_Take_Sickies_on_Monday_Than_Any_Other_Day">It's sickie day</a>. But I <em>am</em> sick!!
