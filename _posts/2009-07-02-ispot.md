I think this one will have to go on my outdoor and general cool stuff list: <a href="http://www.ispot.org.uk/">iSpot</a>. A simple place to list interesting birds, animals, plants, fungi, and whatnot that you've spied but can't positively identify. Somewhat similar to <a href="http://www.naturescalendar.org.uk/">Nature's Calendar</a>, except that Nature's calendar is done for research (National Trust) and the iSpot is just for you, if you're curious. I often notice a critter or plant that I can't quite name easily - hence why I have a huge set of animal and plant books given to me by D.
