I've known for week and weeks my driving theory test was today. I'd paid for it and had a reminder set up on my phone. I'd told my boss I couldn't work overtime today cos I'd be busy. 

I got up at 6am to go the Sheffield so I could be on time for an 0800 test. I'd studied and memorised the thinking and braking and stopping distance at various MPH.

I got there on time and went over my little sheet with important things to remember before I went in.

I handed the lady my licence and my letter notifying me when and where the test was. The lady said something like "um, according to this you should have been here on the 6th".

I looked at the letter. According to it I should have been there on the sixth.

I am bummed.

<span style="font-size:smaller">Maybe I clicked on the wrong date when I booked it. Maybe they made a clerical error when they confirmed the booking. Maybe I'm really, really, stupid *l*</span>
