If it's nice in IE, it sucks in real browsers. if it's nice in real browser IE says whoa there, I'm wonky! and then the aching is being weird and not reloading pages properly when I tell them, so I've probably fixed a half dozen times only to de-fix it when I think it's done nothing. I bet opera or FF has settings I can tinker with *checks*. Oh and I was updating this from work before, and I really really really missed my firefox webdevelopers extension, and the view source chart extension. Sucks to be IE!!!!

**update** except for opera and the comms page it's shinier, I think.
**updated update** opera and comms should be fine now. I added some green dots in the pic's blue / yellow intersections to tie the green in too.
