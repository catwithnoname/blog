Actually, it's not that thrilling really, cos it's IE. <a href="http://www.tatanka.com.br/ies4linux/page/Main_Page">http://www.tatanka.com.br/ies4linux/page/Main_Page</a>. but I can use it in linux for sites that are so stuck up and wicked that they don't work properly on *real* browsers. 

I shouldn't be wasting time, I've got an assignment due in two days.

This is a recurring theme. I wonder sometimes if I should take a break from courses, even just a month, but as it is I'll be qualified in six years or so. I really don't want to extend it. 

I'm also *supposed* to get ahead because the BIG assignment (the pass/fail BIG one) is due while I'm in Israel, so really I should be finishing it two or three weeks early.... I'm slightly worried the quality will suffer from the rush, but really all I need to do is pass with something silly like %40. I could probably get 40% without actually studying at all I think. It's scary to think you need so little to pass. Am I seeing doctors who passed their courses knowing less than half of the material? yikes!
