I've been really enjoying the weird weather we've been getting the last week or three. Lots of quick strong squalls. It does mean that outdoorsey poor me must either stay inside or be prepared to be ubermuddy. 

Today, as work was ending, I realised that the mud was going to get me on the way to the train station no matter what, because there was a LOT of rain. Perhaps mud isn't the best description - it's more like black water. I popped quickly into my biking shorts and pedaled along to the station. By the time I got to the station my pale white legs were pale white legs with lots of dark grey splotches that made them look really hairy. (eeeewwwww lol). The muck that is flicked up off wet roads is really nasty - I like good honest mud more, I think. I got off the train two stations early at Kiveton Park, and biked along the muddy canal towpath that I regularly ride / walk down. I experienced a lot of naughty child pleasure by cycling into muddy puddles and not slowing or trying to avoid them. 

It's a lovely time of year to cycle by the canal. There are still a lot of young birds, either on their own or with their parents. admittedly most other times of the year are lovely times too.  Juvenile <a href="http://www.rspb.org.uk/wildlife/birdguide/name/c/coot/index.asp">coots</a> were still all fluffy and downy, even if they were sized like adults. Most of the ducklings were grown up enough to look like normal mallard ducks, but I did see a few small downy ones. I bothered two <a href="http://www.rspb.org.uk/wildlife/birdguide/name/g/greyheron/index.asp">herons</a>, some swans and cygnets, and a couple of young black balls of wool.. errr... <a href="http://www.rspb.org.uk/wildlife/birdguide/name/m/moorhen/index.asp">moorhens</a>. 

A couple of days ago, I also saw a couple of parent <a href="http://www.rspb.org.uk/wildlife/birdguide/name/c/canadagoose/index.asp">Canada Geese</a> with their single gosling. I've been keeping an eye on these three all spring - it's really lovely to see the tiny gosling (who used to look like a little fluffy yellow duck) now almost completely mature. The parents were really protective of it when it was young, but nowdays they were barely waiting for it to catch up as they ran along the side of the canal. I wonder how much longer before they separate from it entirely. 

I've not seen my Mandarin duck at all recently. I think it must have left the canal at some point during the winter.  

It was a lovely quick cycle ride - 5 miles or so of canalside. When I got home, I was muddier than I ever recall having been. This is a good thing!!! It just makes me smirk inside and outside. I chucked my cycle shoes in the wash because they were filthy and smelly. Hopefully they'll come out in a nice condition. I really need to get a couple more things if I am going to continue cycling in the mud - a hose with a good spray attachment to clean my bike off and perhaps some dorky <a href="http://www.wiggle.co.uk/ProductDetail.aspx?Cat=cycle&ProdID=5360033623&N=dhb%20Waterproof%20Overshoes">overshoes</a>. Some mountainbike tyres with deep treads wouldn't hurt either, since my current roadbike-ey tyres have almost no tread at all, and hence no traction.
