First things first: Wifi on the train is so awesome. Some passengers are less awesome. From Newcastle to Darlington I had to sit by a huge guy who took over a portion of my seat (unwelcome) and who grunted every 20 or 30 seconds (gross, possibly pervy?). This resulted in me leaning out into the aisle to avoid having to touch gruntyman (ewwwwwwwwww) and consequently getting smacked by every person who went past down the aisle. 

I was so glad that he got off after one stop. 

Now, to business. I did it!!!!! wooohoo! At about 1500 today I rode about on a sloppy wet beach and got briny water on my wheels. I'm guessing that with a few short getting-lost sections I did 140 miles+, but I'll need to upload my GPS data to be sure.

I couldn't blog last night cos there was no mobile phone signal at all at Rookhope. And yesterday was a bloody hard day - I went to bed at 2030. Admittedly I read a bit before sleeping, but not a lot! I'd known the day would be difficult, since it's got some humongous climbs, but I was really really really really pooped by the end - I suspect I'd hit "the wall" as it's known. So there was a bit too much walking uphill involved as well. *g*. The day started with the worst climb of all to Hartside, where I had lunch at the summit, and then continued up down up down. Where I could I tried to take the on-road options and not the offroad options, but a couple of times i took the off-road by mistake. One of those was by Garrigil. Despite the signs I genuinely thought I must have taken a wrong turn at first cos it was rough, VERY steep, and uphill!! There was no chance that little wee me could have managed to ride up that section *l* so I plodded up instead. After that the route continued through a beautiful forested area. I noticed the corpse of a fawn on the roadside and said "Oh dear". When I realised that unintentional pun I'd made I cracked up, and then I felt evil for laughing at a poor dead baby deer... further up this road I got a phone call from a computer company consultant who had a position that he thought might interest me. It was a bit weird discussing a potential interview whilst sitting on the edge of a moor in the middle of bloody nowhere. Not long after, I was reallllllyyyyy pleased to see my first red squirrels!! They were at the bird feeder and they're so much prettier than the grey type! I tried to photograph them but I doubt I got any good shots cos they were quite skittish. Eventually I saw a live deer as well, which i scared when it noticed me.... The rest of the track I was on was horrible and offroady and scary for little yochannahs. I think I'm a cyclist but not a mountain biker. Even so, the fauna made the offroad section worth the while. 

I'm not sure how much longer before my stop, best stop now and pack away the laptop...

Oh yeah... don't sniff me right now. I've done alot of cycling and with one backpack you can't carry a lot of changes of clothing....
