So don't be mean to me. I know comments are fucked, but Darren's parents are coming earlier than they said so I have to run!!!! and I can't be bothered changing back to the old theme.

I know, I know. I can't get rid of green and black, it's just too lovely. 

Edit: I got it all working now, I think. It even looks nice on my Eee.
