The rules:
* Link to the person that tagged you.
* Post the rules on your blog.
* Share six non-important things/habits/quirks about yourself.
* Tag six random people at the end of your post by linking to their blogs.
* Let each random person know they have been tagged by leaving a comment on their website.

So:
<ol>
<li>I'm proud of getting bruises, they show I've been doing exciting things. Stiff muscles after physical activity are a good thing too.</li>
<li>I have to have the corners of the bottom sheet tucked in properly (even if it's not on my side) or I fret lots and can't sleep.</li>
<li>I can't stand bookmarks, despite being an avid reader. And not I do NOT bend corners or anything. I just spend a few moments finding my spot each time.</li>
<li>I've needed an eye test for months but keep on putting it off to spend the day walking instead.</li>
<li>I love my bikes to bits but I'm too lazy to oil my chains as regularly as I think I should.</li>
<li>Why did JKR kill Fred??? Why????</li>

I'm too antisocial to know who else to tag! So my line will die out, or something like that...........

</ol>
