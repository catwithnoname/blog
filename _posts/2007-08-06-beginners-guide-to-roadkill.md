Roadkill comes in many shapes, sizes, and splatters. The average motorist notices it very occasionally, normally when a hare the size of a small dog has managed to get dead right in the middle of the street. As a biker, however, you go past roadkill at a much slower speed, allowing you to examine the kill at your leisure. 

Please note: Birds fall into the following categories, but are almost always identifiable long after the average rabbit or hedgehog has become nameless mush.

<ol>
	<li>The first type of roadkill is the "fresh'n'friendly" type. Fresh cos well, it's fresh, and friendly cos it's damaged so little it might just hop up and be friendly. You can just cycle past and examine it closely, but it doesn't have a mark, or if it does, it doesn't appear to be enough to have died from.</li>
	<li>Next comes the roadkills that have been properly killed. You'll still be able to tell it's a rabbit, crow, pheasant, hedgehog, shrew, mouse, etc, but it'll have some guts, tendons, muscles, or bones exposed for all to share. </li>
	<li>"Meaty" is the next step. If the roadkill has progressed to meaty, it may or may not be identifiable. Pink smears are notable along the road, but all very flat. Warning: The faint-hearted may feel a need to gag when they see a particularly meaty smear <i>(I've been caught by this before, a nasty gobbet of rabbit that was very pink and the only time pink meat like that is acceptable to see is on a supermarket shelf)</i>. </li>
	<li>Last category is unfresh, unpink, and unidentifiable. There's skin left, almost like tanned leather in appearance, and no real meat, but what is left is brown. Sizing can help identification a bit - if it's a big smudge, it might be a hare, medium will be a rabbit or a hedgehog, a pheasant if it has feathers. Small might just be a sparrow or a shrew, but it's always hard to tell. </li>
</ol>

I hope this little guide was informative. Next time you pass some roadkill, try to think which category it fits in. As a fun entertainment for the kids, why not print out a tick sheet with room for each category and see who gets the most!
