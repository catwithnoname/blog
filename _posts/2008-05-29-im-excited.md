About loads of things really:

<ol>
<li>I've figured out what Darren's birthday present is going to be. I can't see him not loving it. Heck, I love it, and I want it. It's two months away, and I'm all planned and ready! Bwahahahahaha!</li>
<li>Have I mentioned my <a href="http://international.findmespot.com/">Spot</a>? My other half can be less worried about me when I go walking now, and also track my progress on google maps if he's near a PC. Basically, it's a GPS device with 4 buttons. "Check in" simply logs your location and sends a message or email to whomever you wish, verifying that everything's just fine and dandy. "Help" is a request for some help / contact / investigation, but not an absolute-terror-help-me-save-me-dying-emergency. "911" is.... well... 999? *lol*. This one IS for a absolute-terror-help-me-save-me-dying-emergency. And the last button is just off/on, so who cares...</li>
<li>My brompton. I know I talked about it before but can I jast say.... I'm getting a brompton!!!!!!!!!</li>
<li>I'm going on a really, really, really long walk soon. I'm not even feeling too scared.</li>
<li>I'm working some overtime. Hopefully I'll be able to afford important stuff like citizenship sooner rather than later. </li>
<li>There is no 6.</li>
<li>I'm getting a <a href="http://www.sonyericsson.com/cws/products/mobilephones/overview/k850i?cc=us&lc=en">Sony Ericsson K850i</a> in velvet blue next tuesday, cos my contract expired. Yeeeeeeeehaa.</li>
