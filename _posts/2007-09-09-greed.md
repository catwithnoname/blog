<a href="http://www.transpenninetrail.org.uk/template.asp?ID=505&parentID=504">Transpennine Trail Map 2</a> covers my area. I wouldn't even know I lived close to it if I hadn't tried to go to work via a "shortcut" once. It was a route that was pretty, and would have been a shortcut if I didn't work at an airport. The problem was I came to the end of the trail on the other side of the airstrip. Airstrips are long, cos planes need that. So despite the fact that my work building was probably 100 metres away I actually had another 15 minutes walking to do.... never took that route again. My point was, in any case, that the route I took from Darnall to work was part of the Trans-Pennine Trail. I saw signs saying TPT all over the place and today I finally decided to look it up and see what walk / cycle routes were available to me on it. Now I'm sold. I think I need to create a greed list. I could refer to it whenever I had spare money and wanted to get something for me! Wow!
