Stupid, poopy, OU. I've spent most of the day coding a simplified Java version of an <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enigma_machine">enigma machine</a> as part of my current assignment due on the 19th. None of the steps are particularly difficult but I've spent ages and ages debugging a couple of the sections of my code, mystified as to what could POSSIBLY be wrong. Turns out that when the OU provides code for you to copy and paste, and says "You can test your code as follows" they don't actually mean it, and it's THEIR provided code that's bugged. I re-wrote one of the sections of code from scratch two different ways one time before I realised that the "testing" code they'd given me was wrong, and mine truly honestly was fine. There is some mention of it on forums when students found it out themselves, but no official errata document was provided.  

What a fucking waste of time. Thanks, M255 course staff. I might have had the assignment a lot closer to completion if I hadn't been trying to figure this shit out.
