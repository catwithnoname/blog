<li>I have an <a href="http://www.rocketgardens.co.uk/showdetails.asp?id=102">Instant salad garden</a>. It got delivered last friday, and I stayed up until about midnight planting it.  Most of the plants have acclimatised nicely to their new homes, with the tomatoes still living inside in the bathroom where it's warm. The cucumbers aren't quite impressed with the temps outside, and I'm araid they may die. I'll check on them tonight after work, actually. A couple of the lettuces have died, I think due to being packed tightly in the box and living overnight in the fedex warehouse. The warehouse thing was a big annoyance. I was assured by Rocket Gardens that it would be left at my house if I was unavailable, but when I got home there was a missed delivery note. Several other crappy things had happened that day, and when I saw the note stuck through the door it was just enough to tip me over the edge and make me kick the couch several times in anger. Oh well though. Life goes on. Except for limp lettuces, of course. Unfortunately I don't think it's fair to complain, considering that they said delivery could take 48 hours, and it was within that threshold.</li>

When I'm frustrated at work it's surprising to randomly come across articles that sum it up so well. <a href="http://www.newscientist.com/article/mg20227072.500-embrace-your-inner-grouch.html">New scientist</a>.

I have an assignment due on the 14th, covering the last of my current course work. Revision at Nottingham Trent university on the 16th.... and the exam a month later! The timing is rubbish. I have to keep exam material fresh in my brain for a month after the course ends. Urrrggg gurgle whine. I intend to purchase previous exam papers and aim to complete 4 or 5 of them to keep my hand in, so to speak.

<li>I'm looking forwards to windows 7!!! Once exams are done, I'll download the RC, and do a triple boot with ubuntu, xp, and win 7. Yay, yay, fun!</li>
