I was trying to make that title sound like a cryptic crossword clue but I don't think it really worked. Something like if a crossword wanted to fit in "kit" they'd give the clue "Baby cat, briefly, or half a chocolate bar."..... What made me think about all that? I know not.

The point is, I'm working late cos Ed couldn't and I volunteered for overtime... but banks are shut so I have little to do! I didn't bring my ColdFusion Express book (I am so sold, coldfusion is cool!!! It's not on powweb though, I wonder if I could install it?), so I can't study. I was going to, but then decided that since I was going out to <a href="http://www.chiquito.co.uk/">Chiquito</a> for lunch, I'd not have time to study so why haul it to work and back? but then fate conspired and now I'm at work with little to do anyway.

Back to last friday. That was the day with all the beautiful pics - Darren, Shaun, Min and I went on a pleasant moorland / seaside walk. We'd hoped to see some puffins because lots of birds nest in the cliff walls, but it didn't seem to be the right season so all we really saw were seagulls and some blackish birds. It started out quite dry from the sky, but the groud was very very damp with many puddles and lots of squelchyness. The paths along the cliff edge were well worn and easy to follow, but most of the time they weren't so worn it was a giant bog, which is nice cos giant bogs are... boggy? (remember that pic of me up to the knee in peat, that was from a well eroded peat bog path).

Min is a sheepdog by nature, so she had to chase some naughty sheep away when we passed near them. She also did a lot of pulling, which resulted in Shaun falling onto (and I think soaking) his butt. Further along he stepped on deceptively solid-looking land and got soaked up to the ankle or so. The really bizarre thing was that the earth where he'd trod still looked whole after he'd removed his foot, but it shook and swayed alarmingly, like jelly or boobs or something. Darren and I had a couple of goes prodding it and watching it wriggle. We suggested that giant freaky underground beasts might come up to get us like in Tremors, but they didn't oblige. It wouldn't have mattered if they had come out, because we could always fool them into running out of the cliff, just like in the film.

Next feature of the walk was the seals. Older ones were greyish and looked just like rocks unless they moved. The younger ones where white and blended in even better with the rocky beach while they were dry. In contrast, once it was wet (on the return route it rained) the beach darkened and they stood out really visibly. We have a couple of videos of the seals (short ones) to upload. We also saw them swimming in the sea, several together at one point.

Min was happy to frolic in the peaty mud, so she became a Very Mucky Dog. She ran through all the puddles we skirted, or pounced about in them if she so desired. One the way back one of the boggy bits we'd skirted suddenly told us we should jump it instead. Darren stood beside us and got in-jump pics for both Shaun and I. We both look quite silly - but that's just how you jump when you really truly DON'T want to get caught in the wicked evil cold peaty muddy goop. We didn't, either of us, but it was a close thing... I think we both hit the very very edge of the other side of the mud without quite going in. Darren was a sneak and instead of taking his turn he went around the edge again. I think it's because in the past when Darren and I were walking on Kinder Scout (one of my normal walk territories) once he decided to jump a bog and failed miserably - and hilariously for me, standing on the sidelines safely.

We had indian takeaway that night, from a lovely restaurant that gave us juice to drink while we were waiting for it to be cooked. Yummy, but not as much to say about it as the french *g*. I think we played Risk that night, and I remember that Darren was doing some serious ass-kicking, but the malibu consumed won't let me remember who won...

Saturday we got up earlyish to go and look at a car Shaun and Ulrica were considering buying to replace their falling-to-bits Peugeot 206. It was a lovely warm car ride, so I nodded off to sleep and stayed in the car while they went into the dealership. Darren woke me to tell me they were test riding the new potential and the dealer guy was coming out to price up their car so I had to go in the test ride car now. It was a really nice nap, but the car was worth seeing. I think the main concern was room for baby+min+buggy, preferably keeping baby / min separate from each other. It had quite a bit of room and it had coffeecup holders, so it must be the perfect car.... *g*  

I think it was saturday that we went on the normal min walk down a country lane near their house. It was a very popular dogwalking location, so we met lots of dogs just in the half hour or so we were walking.

We played more risk and Ulrica and Shaun seriously kicked my butt. I wanted Africa dammit! But Shaun's mission was to kill all yellows! He's a colour traitor... He even suggested at one point that maybe Ulrica's mission was to kill all yellows, cos he was so supersneaky he wanted to mislead us all. The game lasted so long I kept on falling asleep between dice rolls *l*.

Sunday Darren was sick with a fever and stayed abed (or at least acouch) most of the day. Shaun and I walked Min to a cool castle they was undergoing restoration, and then on the beach. I picked up a couple of shells when I couldn't help myself, and I think that my pocket still has sand in it. Pics to follow. I was quite proud of getting photos of min on the beach, because most of the time she was just a speck in the distance. She tried to chase some horses at one point, or might have been just trying to play with the dog following them, I'm not sure.

Monday we packed and set off midday for home. As usual it all went entirely too fast :( but we were looking forward to seeing our small furry pest again. She was sooooooooooooo affectionate when we get her back from the cattery. It was lovely! (tangent: this morning she came up to give us a hug while we were both still in bed. When she gives us love she always drools for some reason. This time she decided to shake her head, like a wet dog does, and she sprayed drool everywhere! The only bits of us outside the blanket were our faces, but that's probably the least pleasant place for kitten drool. Darren got some in his eyes too apparently *lol* gross animal).

Anyway, now it's time or me to go and create the handover document for the nightshift.
