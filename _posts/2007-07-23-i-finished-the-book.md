No more Potters. Bummer, eh? good to read up really late and not care cos I'm on holiday. one day longer than I thought, too - I thought I was back at work this Friday, but apparently I have it off!! I asked Tony at work to send me the rota so I'd know when they wanted me from a shift point of view (my shifts are normally fixed cos I'm just pretty cool, but i thought it'd be best to ask just in case..) apparently they've even got people on standby to do overtime if for some reason I don't get back properly. I find that a bit funny cos they didn't do that when mat went to Spain! So they probably think I'm dodging bullets and stuff all the time here. *l*. Of course when I think about it there are bullets lying around on the ground, but it's just normal here and the three I saw were all very old. One was live and old and I picked it up then got scared cos I don't know if old bullets become more volatile and this one was quite old. My sibs wanted to take it home but I wouldn't let them. I think I reacted that was because of silly tv programs where science teachers handle old dynamite and go kerplooey. Only it's a good tv program, really. 

Going home wednesday :( but also there's some :) cos I get to see my kitty!!!
