I am a crazy dog who knows the word "walk" and get excited when I hear it. Or something. Anyway, everyone knows my free time is often my walking time. Last night I was up quite late looking for a walk route, installing printer drivers so I could print out the details. I was trying to do this in windows at about midnight, and the driver thingy from HP was an awful 50 meg installer that took ages to scan my computer. I ended up ctrl+alt+deleting and using task manager to kill it because it wouldn't let me shut down while it was doing what ever it was doing. I hope I haven't damaged my registry or anything. I get the impression it want me to install printing utilities and programs and ink monitors and who knows what other crap. Bah. All I wanted was a nice streamlined file to make my printer go. Once I finally killed the install and booted up opensuse I got my prints out straight away - it only took a minute or so to install the printer on Opensuse. 

Anyway, eventually I got the <a href="http://www.walkingbritain.co.uk/walks/walks/walk_b/1286/">route guide</a> printed out. Preparing for a walk takes a lot longer than it used to b/c of my GPS. I do three things:

<ul>
<li>Mark my route out on a paper map</li>
<li>Load significant waypoints, landmarks, geocaches etc onto my GPS</li>
<li>Print out geocache location hints and the route description</li>
</ul>

Collating all of the geocache info takes a while - I don't want to print out 15 pages if there are 15 geocaches in the area, so I copy and paste the info that's relevant to me onto a word processor and resize the text and cram as much as I sensibly can in on one page. An example of a geocache I've found is <a href="http://www.geocaching.com/seek/cache_details.aspx?guid=ab38c75f-7b1f-4ba4-a977-3d3643a74c77">here</a>.

I think I got to sleep about half past twelve. I got to sleep in quite a bit, got up at 0840 to get the 0915 train. Everything was prepared in in my backpack the night before so there was no need to rush when I got up. I don't take long to get ready, anyway. Arrived at Hope just before 11. Set off, found where I was going nice and easily. After a few minutes there was a weird siren that went on for several minutes. I don't really know how to describe it in western-ey terms, but if I was in Israel I would think it was to do with memorial / mourning / death - a minute or two of silence all over the country during a ceremony.  Or perhaps a bomb warning. Here, they don't use the a siren for silences, and I don't know what an air raid / attack siren might sound like. I was half expecting to find out sheffield had been obliterated or something, and even turned around to look at the brightness behind me (which might have been a bad idea if it was a bomb *lol*) but the brightness was just the sun. I guess the sun's rare enough atm to be noticeable? *lol* It was a looooovely bright day today, most of the time. The siren stopped after five minutes or so, with no obvious explanation - but I did also hear a police or ambulance siren as well, so my best guess is some sort of local emergency, like perhaps a mountain rescue? 

My route took me directly up the side of lose hill, a very very steep hill at the end of a long ridge between two valleys. At the top the wind was at its craziest, and seemed desperate to blow me off the south edge of the ridge. I didn't let it though *g*. I met many many ramblers at the top of the ridge, and we all had one conversation topic: the wind. It varied depending on the amount of shelter, but was noticeable all the way along the ridge, which I followed for quite a while before descending. The worst bit was at the trig point on Mam Tor - I tried talking to someone but just couldn't hear what they were saying because of the howling. I don't think I've ever experienced such strong winds before. (Random thought: as much as Min likes walks I bet she wouldn't have liked this one much!) <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mam_Tor">Mam Tor</a> is pretty cool, you can easily see the outlines of ancient fortifications on it. I imagine it would have been an incredibly secure location. Anyone who wanted to storm the walls would already be exhausted from the steep ascent, whether weather conditions were fine or not. I don't know if it's a time when siege engines were used - but if they were, it would have been a tremendous struggle to get any up. I left the ridge at Mam tor and went back down into the valley. I passed a place called "Windy Knoll" which made me laugh. Calling it a windy knoll is certainly correct - but it's a bit like calling Antarctica "Icy Plateau". No shit, sherlock!! 

The majority of my descent was through a very steep limestone ravine known as <a hred="http://www.nationaltrust.org.uk/main/w-vh/w-visits/w-findaplace/w-highpeakestate/w-highpeakestate-countryside/w-east_midlands-places-winnatspass.htm">Winnat's Pass</a>. I don't recall ever seeing or hearing of it before, which surprises me, because it was stunning. The wind continued its forceful gusts all the way down, and the ravine was so hidden in shadow my breath was misting in front of me on a perfectly sunny day. It's a lot colder going downhill than it is uphill! It's kinda weird that exhausting activity is more rewarding and enjoyable just because it keeps you warm enough. The bottom of the pass was quite close to Castleton. Shaun and Ulrica will remember going through endless tourist stores looking for playing cards here, and also looking for food before giving up and catching the bus to Hope *l*... From Castleton to Hope I had a nice quick journey along flat easy land, and finally, being in the bottom of the valley, no wind!! I had to cross a railway line that didn't have a bridge or underpass at one point. I think it was a line that serviced the nearby concrete factory, rather than a passenger train line. I made it back to Hope train station with about 20 minutes to spare before the next train. 20 minutes is a lovely margin - all too often I have to hurry my ass off to make the train, or else I miss it by 15 or 20 minutes and half an hour or more to wait for the next one. 

The <a href="http://trail.motionbased.com/trail/activity/4879114">Motionbased GPS data thingy</a> for this walk is pretty cool. To me, at least *g*. I love how I can see the contours of the ridge - the highest peak in the graph is the top of mam tor, where it was windiest. The only thing that niggles me about the data is that while I can choose metric units or imperial units, I can't have a mixture. I want my distances in miles and my temperatures in C, because that's how data is presented to me in everyday situations in the UK. So I looked at the 15.3 kilometres and say "huh?". Google tells me 15.3 km = 9.5 miles. The route guide I printed told me it was 8.5, but I don't mind doing more. I love pushing myself, I guess. When it's summertime, I fully intend to take an 18 mile route all the way around Kinder that I have seen detailed somewhere... Ah, it's <a href="http://www.walkingbritain.co.uk/walks/walks/walk_b/2615/">Route 2615</a> on WalkingBritain. It must be in summer purely because the day won't be long enough otherwise!! I'm sure it will be a peat-tastic day.

Sleepy now. Well, to be truthful, sleepy since about when I was on Mam Tor... *l*.

Oh yes, I'm a druid. 


You Are A:

True Neutral Human Druid (4th Level)


Ability Scores:
Strength- 13
Dexterity- 14
Constitution- 15
Intelligence- 15
Wisdom- 13
Charisma- 13

Alignment:
True Neutral- A true neutral character does what seems to be a good idea. He doesn't feel strongly one way or the other when it comes to good vs. evil or law vs. chaos. Most true neutral characters exhibit a lack of conviction or bias rather than a commitment to neutrality. Such a character thinks of good as better than evil after all, he would rather have good neighbors and rulers than evil ones. Still, he's not personally committed to upholding good in any abstract or universal way. Some true neutral characters, on the other hand, commit themselves philosophically to neutrality. They see good, evil, law, and chaos as prejudices and dangerous extremes. They advocate the middle way of neutrality as the best, most balanced road in the long run. True neutral is the best alignment you can be because it means you act naturally, without prejudice or compulsion. However, true neutral can be a dangerous alignment because it represents apathy, indifference, and a lack of conviction.

Race:
Humans are the most adaptable of the common races. Short generations and a penchant for migration and conquest have made them physically diverse as well. Humans are often unorthodox in their dress, sporting unusual hairstyles, fanciful clothes, tattoos, and the like.

Class:
Druids- Druids gain power not by ruling nature but by being at one with it. They hate the unnatural, including aberrations or undead, and destroy them where possible. Druids receive divine spells from nature, not the gods, and can gain an array of powers as they gain experience, including the ability to take the shapes of animals. The weapons and armor of a druid are restricted by their traditional oaths, not simply training. A druid's Wisdom score should be high, as this determines the maximum spell level that they can cast.
