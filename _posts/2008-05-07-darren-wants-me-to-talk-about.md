oh, nevermind. Anyway, what was I saying before? I was talking about Brave New world. As I said, the plot sucked a wee bit - mostly I considered it irrelevant, which in a book is a bit strange because aren't books mostly about plots? The world fascinated me, and the book gripped me even when I was bored by the plot. Is it horrible to say that the world didn't seem particularly bad, even when it thrived on depriving - perhaps it could even be described as mutilating - embryos before birth, in order to produce a complacent workforce and "happy" society? It's a point to make you think, if nothing else. 
A lot of the technology in the book was irrelevant, because it's set about 400 years in the future (from when the book was written in the 1930s) and yet the technology level is lower than today's. Even a "sci-fi" author can't foresee electronics and the differences it makes in our lives, I guess. 
I was intrigued by the idea of many women being born sterile, and society not looking at a woman like she's bad/broken because she doesn't plan to have children. If you know me you'd probably know that I would like that bit, though *l*.  I wonder if the book's take on things suggesting that women wouldn't even want children at all if society didn't expect them to want them is realistic - or whether it's an instinctual thing that no amount of "programming" will overcome - or will most women <em>always</em> go "awww" when they see a child and silently think "I need one of those", regardless of society and conditioning? Blech. Then again, the book did say that women went through a pregnancy substitute, using drugs, to fool the body into thinking it had gone through pregnancy. Hmmm. 

I had a great martial arts class last night. The class was particularly small, and for a change Sensei Rob had us leading the stretches and directing the class for a bit. I'm pretty sure he deliberately left my worst stretch until it was my turn to see if I'd go easy on the class (and hence myself) or not. Basically it involves squatting down, leaving your hands on the floor or grasping your ankles, and standing straight up and locking your knees. I TRIED not to go easy, but I might have - it always seems like an eternity to me when we do that particular stretch anyway, so I could have ended it earlier than normal and not realised.... *l* when I finally decided I couldn't do it any longer I looked over at him and he was grinning so I decided it was safe to tell everyone to stop. It's an evil stretch, I tells ya!!!

I'm going to go read my book now - Odalisque by Fiona McIntosh. It's got an annoying obsession-at-first-sight thingy going on. That always annoys me cos it's always true sweet undying love even though they don't bloody know each other.... *snort*
