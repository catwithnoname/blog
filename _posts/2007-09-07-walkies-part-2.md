Last we knew I was busy being stung on the bum by some wicked nettles. (I reckon my reaction to them wasn't as bad as it should have been cos I'm on antihistamines for my hayfever. Shaun probably knows.) I continued on through the gorsey slatey area. There were many sheep left free to roam, and they had made their own tracks. Considering that the track was faint and not well walked already, this made keeping in the right direction moderately confusing. I think at this point I was still mostly on the right track, though. I wonder if the area is called Chinley Churn because there is so much churned up slate everywhere, in larger and smaller blocks and some scree-like slopes.

Methinks that's a good example. 

Another important plant to note is the rush. I think it's a Compact Rush, aka <a href="http://images.google.co.uk/images?hl=en&q=juncus+conglomeratus&btnG=Search+Images&gbv=2" style="font-style:italic">Juncus Congolmeratus</a>. I just looked it up in my book and Google image search (obviously) because I didn't know what it was called. I'd already observed that my feet always get wet when it's growing around, so it wasn't surprising  to find out it was a rush. For some reason in my head when I read books that talked about fresh rushes strewn on the floor or stuffing the bedding I'm imagined something similar to a palm leaf. No idea why, really. I took this pic to remind me to find out what they were when I got home.

I'd intended to bring my <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/0002200716?ie=UTF8&tag=cat09-21&linkCode=as2&camp=1634&creative=6738&creativeASIN=0002200716">book</a><img src="http://www.assoc-amazon.co.uk/e/ir?t=cat09-21&l=as2&o=2&a=0002200716" width="1" height="1" border="0" alt="" style="border:none !important; margin:0px !important;" /> with me to identify plants and birds and the like, but sometimes I'm useless. I have the full set of those books, and they really rock. The one above is a sort of covers-all-common-stuff one, good for walking rather than taking a book each for insects, trees, flowers, mammals, birds, etc. It's in my lap atm. Anyway, if you see rushes, go around them, not through if you can, and if you have a choice, go uphill of them, not downhill. Wet feet. Peat stuck in your shoes. Squelchy socks. No. 

I reckon I also saw lots of <a href="http://www.catwithnoname.com/photos/chinley2/images/05092007253.jpg">Tormentil</a>. What a name for a flower! The example is a tad insect eaten. I saw nicer ones later on but was too lazy to do more photos. 

Next interesting thing in line was the <a href="http://www.catwithnoname.com/photos/chinley2/images/05092007257.jpg">contraption</a>. I have other shots, <a href="http://www.catwithnoname.com/photos/chinley2/images/05092007256.jpg">here</a>, <a href="http://www.catwithnoname.com/photos/chinley2/images/05092007258.jpg">here</a>, <a href="http://www.catwithnoname.com/photos/chinley2/images/05092007259.jpg">here</a>, & <a href="http://www.catwithnoname.com/photos/chinley2/images/05092007263.jpg">here</a>. It was thoroughly corroded. I looked around to see if I could see a slot of some sort to insert a crank, since it looks like it should have had a rope wound on it at some point. I couldn't find one. I tried to see if it turned, but wasn't surprised when it didn't... Even if it ever had, it was too rusted together to do so now. The only function I can imagine is to lower slate down off the hill and into the valley. My next pic shows that humans have certainly gotten involved building with and possibly mining slate. This one has some sort of sitting place, or perhaps some sort of fireplace or hearth? There's an old weathered plank on the top of it.

Strolling along further, I encountered <a href="http://www.catwithnoname.com/photos/chinley2/images/05092007274.jpg">this guy</a>. He wasn't cool. He was a loner. Dare I say... a black sheep? 


I think it's about now that I started to get off the path I'd planned. Basically, when I got off the train at Chinley, I was going to head due north until I hit Hayfield, and then go west a few extra miles to New Mills. I was kind of aware I might have been going too far west at this point, but I didn't realise how far and didn't mind too much since it was still in the direction I wanted to wind up anyway. The trail I was on kinda petered out all of a sudden. I think I'd been following sheep trails for some time, cos I just hit a barbed wire fence at the end of the track. Barbed wire isn't hard to climb over, really, so I did that. I'm pretty sure I was walking on non-access land for quite some time. I spent ages with my map and route directions sitting in wet grass and looking at landmarks trying to figure out what was going on. This was really stressful, primarily cos wherever I wound up, I'd still have to get to New Mills by foot. That was the nearest train stop,which I already had a ticket for, and I had almost no money with me, and no card to get money out. Paid travel was not an option, prettymuch. 

I saw a farm and decided to home in on it. With any luck it'd be a farm that was named and present on my map. When I got close, the dogs started to bark. That was fine at first, 'til they ran up to me still barking. I'm a dog lover usually, but suddenly it occurred to me that if they really wanted to guard their territory and didn't think I should be there... they might attack. They might not - my parents' dogs bark to say "don't be there far away, be over here playing with me!" but that doesn't mean all dogs think that. The notion of dogbites didn't appeal. I started to walk away, then my nerve broke as I heard them still approaching, and I ran my poor little legs off and climbed over a fence. I think I've already mentioned I hate climbing over drywall? 

Not too long after, I struck a public bridleway, and figuring it had to lead somewhere, I followed it. It not only led to a road, it led to a road with a local dude on it! he gave me directions and told me I was at the edge of New Mills, without having gone through hayfield first. *l* That was fi-i-i-i-i-ne by me, cos I didn't really feel too walky anymore. 

I walked through town to the station and was thoroughly impressed when someone said to me "I like your hat. Is it a <a href="http://www.barmahhats.com.au/">Barmah?</a>" And it is!

The feathers might be my own edition... One peahen, one pheasant. It's the best hat in the world! it's also one of the few things I will ever be "Large" in. I think I could have comfortably worn even an extra large. I think this is a family trait, this big headedness *l* cos I know mum has problems finding hats that are big enough to fit her head. Tight hats give me a headache, too. 

I got home on the train okay. New Mills is an interesting place, with deep valleys and the beautiful river Goyt. I intended to revisit one day, when the stress I associate with the location has lessened *l*
