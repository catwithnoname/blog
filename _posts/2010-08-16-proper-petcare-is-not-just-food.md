In the beginning, there was Elsie the beautiful little dog, who I think might have been a mottled brown Staffordshire Terrier. She had a boydog partner who arranged for her to have a litter of little babydogs. Much cuteness ensues, but the big boydog got aggressive and had to move home, never to be seen again.

Then came two kittens, one pure black, and one black and white. I have told the story of the black and white little girl before. She was not loved, and was so hungry she would sneak into our house regularly to steal food and slept in the neighbours' bin. She got a temporary home at my mother in law's house, but did not get on with the dog, so had to move on too. Hopefully now she's happy, being cat number 5 in a very catty household.

Before the beautiful black and white girlcat left, another doggie appeared, in Alsatian form. She's big enough to ride and very friendly. Most of the time we see her in a cage though the neighbour's door, and I've never seen her with a lead on to go for a walk. I've not seen Elsie go for a walk either. 

Yesterday, I had fun sitting outside and *trying* to take Folksy photos - but spending quite a lot of time stroking <a href="http://picasaweb.google.com/yochannah/NextdoorSnosk#">the lovely little black boycat</a>, who had assigned himself to "helping the humans" duty. We like each other well enough that he assertively plopped down on my lap a couple of times and began to purr, as well as just generally getting in the way as cutely as possible.

Before little black and white girlcat left us we noticed she had started growing faster than the boycat. This mostly meant she was catching him up in size, since she'd been a hungry cat up 'til then. Now we've figured out why boycat isn't growing too fast. I saw some gross squirmy white worms dangling from his rear today. :( I wish that next door's version of care didn't involve mostly having animals about and feeding them occasionally. What about vaccinations, regular health treatments (yes, I mean worming pills or drops!), flea treatments (this was a problem with black and white girlcat - she gave our cats fleas...) and so on? If you take an animal in, aren't you supposed to *care* for it?

I has a sad :( buying deworming drops for my monsters in case they've picked anything up from him, and I'll try to gently mention it to the neighbours if I see them, but I don't think it's likely much'll be done about the worms... How can he grow to full catly size without being able to absorb the food he eats because parasites get it instead?
