11 comments marked as spam today. I only cleaned out three last night and thirty or so the week before. I wonder if I can hide this blog from search engines to see if that helps, or if it's too late and my soul is sold to SPAM!

I don't want justin timberlake lyrics, new ringtones, or a bigger or erecter penis. I don't even have one. And I know that Spam obviously doesn't bother discriminating, the idea is mass comments regardless of whether or not you're interested, in the hopes that there will be three or four respondents every now and then.

I think the ones that say "nice site, thanks!" are sneaky, but still easy to recognise as spam... so are the weird quotes ones that say something about augustus caeser. I wonder if I'll see any ones that could almost be confused for a real thing one day.

Actually.... would anyone mind having to register to make comments? That would make it less a pain-in-the-butt
