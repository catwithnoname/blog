What could possibly go wrong? I went out with <a href="http://www.rotherhamwheelerscc.co.uk/p_Home.ikml">Rotherham Wheelers Cycling Club</a> on a shortish ride today, expecting to be stuck behind and breathing pure ventolin after not long at all. I also sneakily drank lots of lucozade beforehand, and I bothered to eat breakfast rather than a quick cereal bar like normal. 

Shireoaks, outside the church at 10:00..... I'm there, ready, wondering if they'd actually said 10:30 and I was confused. About ten minutes later a large group of cyclists turned up though, so I hopped back on my bike and set off with them. I actually had met one of the cyclists in the group, since he works at Fujitsu, and suggested that I join. Apart from that they were all strangers, but thankfully they were very friendly ones. I got introduced to some, but I'm terrible with names in general, never mind trying to identify cyclists who look similar (and also a bit like aliens) in their cycling gear. The names'll stick in my brain eventually I'm sure. 

Straight away I was introduced to concepts like cycling two abreast and keeping behind others to remain super duper aerodynamic, out of the wind. (This had truly never ever occurred to me). My bike has tyres that are thick and slow me down far too much, and I need to be kitted out with a road bike, apparently. I can't argue very much when people suggest I get more bikes. I <em>like</em> bikes. 

You can talk whilst cycling! I did not know this! I did not know <em>I</em> could talk whilst cycling, either. Darren said I sounded strange when I got home though - it seems it took a while for me to remember how to use my inside voice again, and I was a bit hoarse. I'm pretty sure I'll have a scratchy voice when I get older, with all the yelling I do. I love to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kiai">Kiai,</a> too.

A group of slowpokes including me (if three can be called a group) split off from the main group, so I cycled and chatted to the other two I was with. I seem to be going cycling again on Friday with Steve, and I was paid the compliment of compliments near the end of the ride - he called me fit. Is there a better way to suck up to me? I am egotistical and love deserved compliments, so there probably is. It was an unexpected compliment coming from people who I'm sure are my cycling superiors. (This is all assuming I wasn't being told I'm <em>hot</em>, which is an entirely less exciting interpretation of the word fit...)

I'm pretty sure I'm going to join the club and get seriousish about it for a bit. Once I start studying again though, will I be able to maintain the pace? I think I'll have to cut down again - I'm NOT going to cut down on my martial arts, this much I know. Beating class comes first.
