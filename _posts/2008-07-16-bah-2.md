Working on the sheer boredom that is my ECA. I've been pretty good today and got a reasonable deal done. I also managed to get a nice snippet roughed out on the train the other day. When I went to combine it with the rest of the report, I discovered it was corrupt. I know exactly why - I shut down my Eee without making sure I'd saved it properly. It's the second time I've done it, and nothing I can think of allows me to recover it. 

It's not a big loss, just annoying. It was really all just the crap being spewed from my brain put into writing (like this blog, but even less coherent) rather than anything I could submit to anyone. But still. Poop. 

I'm going to try and amend the auto-save settings on OpenOffice now. Save every hmmm... three seconds? yeah, that's JUST want I want on a SSD.... *lol*
