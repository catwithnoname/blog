The other thing is my bikelock! I went to get a prescription today and wanted to lock up my bike but after 15 minutes of trying to get it off my bike so I could lock it to the bike place thingy gave up, and bikes across to the other end of town where I'd just come from, bought another bike, and biked back again to finally get the prescription. Then I got home and decided to try another key (it came with several) to get my original bike lock off the bike... and it worked. Hmph. I think I'm still better of with a new one anyway, cos I daren't let my self get stuck with the bike not willing to unlock when I'm in sheffield and no way home! *L*
