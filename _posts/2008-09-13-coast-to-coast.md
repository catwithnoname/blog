… LA to Chicago…. Or so the song goes. Those are the wrong coasts though. I’m thinking from the Irish sea to the North sea, by bike. I’ve been daydreaming about it for quite some time now. It’s about 150 miles, at the narrowish section I’ll be doing it. Start of October. Three days. Woohoo. Anyone wanna come? My sweetie can’t cos long bike rides break non cyclists. *lol*
