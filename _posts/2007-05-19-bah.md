When you write a lovely long post and a misplaced backspace goes back on the browser and wipes it....

I was saying how much I loved my all-in-one phone... it does radio/mp3s/camera/PDA/phone/web browser... you can't really get cooler than that. I'd not approve of an all-in-one home stereo/games console/tv/pc thingy though cos I often have the tv and the pc on at once...and I imagine families with more than one or two people would definitely want all these things on at once...

I need to find out how to get LEGAL MP3s... both places I've seen have them for exactly the same prices as the albums, so what's the point really, I might as well buy the CD and rip it instead. That'd also not waste my bandwidth.

Also, on Wednesday Darren and I took a couple of trains to <a href="http://www.derbyshireuk.net/hope.html"> Hope</a> (which is where Shaun and Ooli and us went to buy groceries once and discovered it's a long walk to the train station...) and then walked up to Win hill, which gives an amazing view of everything from the summit. See <a href="http://www.digicam69.co.uk/winhill.htm"> these pics </a> they're not ours, they're actually on a <em>sunny</em> day... but they show the beauty. There were lots of sheep with lambs that were cute and frolicky with springs in their feet that made them Poing! We descended down into the valley at the end of the day just in time, cos by the time we were back in hope when we looked up all the peaks were cloaked on fog... would have gotten really lost if we'd still been up there....


anyway, matt's here *off*
