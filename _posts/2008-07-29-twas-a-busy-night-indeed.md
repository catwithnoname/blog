So... the bike ride there was nice, the route was easy to follow, and the temperature was dreamy. I'm so incredibly happy at the moment about the warmth. I LOVE not having to wear 3+ layers in order to be warm enough. It's just a shame that work is so climate controlled that I still need to wear loads even when it's warm. The rest of the UK is rolling about in agony because it's... omg! 25! Sweltering!! &lt;/sarcasm&gt; and I'm just about happy enough to weep. Seriously. Beer belly guys keep on thinking that the heat means they should take off their tops. Ugh. Put away the paunch, guys. I've lived in a far hotter country where people didn't feel the need to show oversized guts all the time. And that is generally, not relevant to religious status. 

Once I got to their house I quite quickly figured out that there were two big problms. 
1) Her laptop had been through a system restore since I'd handed it back to her a week or two ago. There goes the time wasted configuring it for her the first time....
2) Her router had been restored to system settings. She didn't know what her ISP username or password was. 

After much boring hold time I managed to get through to her ISP and get them to give me the password and username, once I'd provided a few key details to prove I was legit. Once the router was configured I had to install internet security. Remember how I'd said I was confused that Norton was on her laptop, since I'd removed it? It was back on because she'd done the system restore, and since Darren presumed that Zonealarm was still on the laptop and had talked her through uninstalling it, her computer was now naked to the world. Installing Zonealarm, AVG antivirus, Firefox, and printer drivers took aaaages. HP has so much bloatware and crap that it installs - all I want are drivers, goshdarn it. Her HP printer was pretty crappy (I didn't say it to her, just thought it) and had only one light on it. The light blinking could mean paper jam, ink cartridge fault, no paper, or a trillion other things - all it really let you know was that SOMETHING was wrong - but not what. Eventually I found out it was the colour cartridge. Black and white test prints came off fine, so I've left her with everything all installed and working.... I hope. 

The ride back was a bit scary. It was after nine and although the journey started out while it was still light, it got dark before I got home - and my dynamo had a nut slightly loose and wouldn't hold firmly on the tyre... biking in the dark with no street lights in a 60mph zone is less than fun. 

I got home at 10:20 in the night, had tea, a bath, and went to bed. Blargh.
