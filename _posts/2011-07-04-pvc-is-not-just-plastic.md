I am blogging, which is reason enough for anyone's heart to skip a beat ;)

Went to A&E due to unpleasant heart palpitations on friday night (thankfully we live prettymuch around the corner from it the hospital). Was diagnosed with PVCs: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Premature_ventricular_contraction">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Premature_ventricular_contraction</a>. They're benign for most part, but I've still been told to see a GP for further investigation.

I've been experiencing them every day since, and it seems pretty likely to me that the trigger is Darren's upcoming redundancy (16th July 2011). It seems pretty damn obvious to me that it's mostly due to pure selfishness in a way that really, really ticks me off. Yesterday I remarked how much I'd have like to stop at a pub and have tea outside in the warm sun, but was sad we couldn't afford it. Shortly thereafter I got several hours of frequent palpitations.

It'd make more sense if we weren't pretty freaking confident we'll be able to afford it ok if we don't splurge. My pay is good and likely to continue to get better.

So, dear self: Please stop it.

Going to doc shortly as advised by A&E. Funny how having to miss work increases my stress levels.
