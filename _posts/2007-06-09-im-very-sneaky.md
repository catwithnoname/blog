Cos I'm at work! Bwahahahahahahahaha!

There's bugger all to do, y'see.

So on wednesday I did the walkies thing again. sunburnt, but less. A nice nine miles from Grindleford through padley gorge (the gorge has poopycoloured water because it has run through peat at some point earlier on in its flow.... it on the edge of moors after all!) and to fox house, then along burbage edge and stanage edge to hathersage. This mostly meant moors to my right and a cliff "edge" to my left. At hathersage I bought a bumbag (I want something to have my mobile phone and walking snacks in front of me... backpacks go on my back so they don't work). I know they are dorky but not so dorky on walkers I think.  Of course I had told darren I wanted one and he offered to usr his falkonsenses to locate one, which I didn't find out until after I bought mine meant he was going to go to his mum and dad's after work and pick one up from there *l* so I feel a bit bad about that... he got it so fast! sneakyness.  I also got a map of the dark peak only to find out I also want a map of the white peak. MMmmmph. the dark peak will tide me over for a while I guess *g*.

I feel like I know the area well enough I'd not get too lost even without a map, but it's still a useful tool.

I'm not going on a walk for at least two weeks now *sad*. Next week I have to do I driving lesson in the AM and need to be at the clinic for depo at 1400. The week after I have my driving theory. Come to think of it, what time is that? if it's early I could still do a walk possibly!! I can probably check it online somewhere but don't remember where. I have some paper with the info on at home. I'll check then. I plan to bike there (wherever "there" is) from the train station, so that will give me a whee bit of excitement in my day. I wish I had a real bike that I could take around the peak district again. I'm saving up, but I don't even know how much I need. I might do some scouting out of bike shops in sheffield on the 20th when my test is, if there's not enough time for a good walk. I need to get feelers for how much I need. I know I could easily afford a cheap bike for the amount I have already in my bike fund, but I don't want cheap crap, I want goodness!  Other people have probably heard me say I don't want them to recommend a girl bike either, I just want a bike. I don't mean I don't want one that fits me well or isn't made for my shape, but I don't want the store people to think that I am going to be one of those people who puts her bike on her car, takes it to some boring flat track everyone else has biked around a hundred times, and later leaves the bike in the shed 'til next bank holiday, because she's saddlesore from a half hour ride. Nosiree.

It's my birthday later this month *hinthinthint* buy me a bike,world!!

On a different note, I am completing my conversion into geekdom. I think soon I will be using solely opensuse. some teething problems like setting up the network with darren's pc - i can see it but not acccess it, nor the printer. needs some more tinkering (and probably babying from Nord).

that's all for now. I'm going back to my book.
