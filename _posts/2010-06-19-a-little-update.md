Mostly life has been difficult enough that I've been unable to do the blogging I'd have liked to do (blogging in my head doesn't count.....) partially because things have been too sensitive, or study is needed, and quite often simply because I am spending a lot of time at Darren's mum's house, which is a dead zone for mobile phone internet, and doesn't have anything like a work desk where I can sit and use my Eee without straining my already miserable wrists and fingers. 

But, saying that: Life is settling down a bit now, I think. 
<ul>
<li>I don't have any study for a few months. Woo! A break! But also poo, I want my degree faster! I'm no longer 10 and in need of summer holidays to run wild and free! (I just run wild and free whenever I can anyway). </li>
<li>Darren and I have settled into a rough pattern of eating most meals at his mum's house, except for sometimes when she comes around to ours. </li>
<li>Hopefully I'll be able to start Martial Arts up again next week. I trieeeeed to last week, texted Sensei, but found out classes were cancelled. In my head my body has become a giant exerciseless balloon after the hectic last few months, but I can't be too bad really. I've managed to get out on my bike a few times for short and mediumish rides. </li>
<li>I have a freaking car. I hate cars. The insurance cost me Â£900 which is just.... nasty. I have a year of no claims (and probably did the most driving!) but as I wasn't the primary policyholder they don't give a poopie about my lack of claims. So hopefully Darren's mum will pass her test soon and I can get rid of the damn thing. Aren't females supposed to get cheaper insurance? Urgh blurgh.</li>
<li> I have a few domain names and interwebby projects that have been on hold for a few months. I intend to try and polish them some more, and get portfolioriffic. My new employers have made my job so brain numbing and full of dead end admin that I'm just waiting for the team redundancy announcement... I wanna do code for money!!</li>
<li>Something embarrassingly girly that I'll save for last: when D's dad first went into hospital we were looking for things to do that weren't normal things, because we didn't want to assiciate shitty times with those activities. We stopped MMORPGing (LOTRO), table top gaming too..... bought bookshelves to make the attic even tidier, so on. At the time, I found some old beads I'd bought and an old flame flared up..... So I've spent FAR too much on beads, threads, cords, and findings recently. Buy some of it here, for yourself, for your friends, for your Significant Others... or just spread the word for me, to anyone you think might buy some. I'll be grateful, and if I know you're the spreader, I'll give you free stuff... See the link: </li>
