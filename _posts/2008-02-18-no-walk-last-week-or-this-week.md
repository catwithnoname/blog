My leg was so bad after / during my last walk (and indeed after recent martial arts lessons) that I decided not to give into my yearning to walk last week. Biking was forbidden as well... No walk this week either :( next week I shall NOT take no, even if I limp and whimper afterwards. 

On the positive side, I'm doing some useful things - I am getting my eyes tested this week, and a needle stuck into my bum to make my ovaries less of a liability for another three months. The evil things need an off switch. I keep on thinking I should get an implant, but I'm vaguely worried that different drugs might allow my period to come back and I desperately don't want that. I'm soooooooo happy not having had a period for over a year now. Who wants to bleed all the time? Ewwww!!!

<a href="http://www3.open.ac.uk/courses/bin/p12.dll?C01TT381">My current course</a> has been fascinating these first three weeks, and I've submitted my first assignment already (just a nice easy 20 multichoice question one). This week the courseload has been hilariously easy - the main thing they wanted you to do was install apache, php, and mysql. In plain english that means running a server on your own computer, so you can test the scripts and webpages you've developed. They listed loads of various ways to download, configure, and test the applications, for mac osx, windows, linux, etc... Of course I'd had no idea they would spend a whole week talking about it so I'd done it whilst preparing for the course. Installing it all on OpenSuSE is a laugh anyway. Click click click, test, there you go. 

I've discovered it's forbidden to blog about my work without submitting your blogpost to marketing for their approval first *lol* Would anyone mind if it made it so you have to register to see (some) posts?
