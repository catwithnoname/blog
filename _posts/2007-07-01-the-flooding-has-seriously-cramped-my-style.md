I've been living on a work/travel/eat/sleep basis alone the last four or five days. Tue / Wed I could not get to work (well I don't know about buses/trains on Wednesday but I had the day off anyway so it's irrelevant I guess). I'd been told originally that due to a landslide the trains might be out for a week, so I was forced to try the bus thing. There's no direct bus from Worksop to sheffield, so I'm forced to take three different buses.

Thursday I left on the 0620 AM bus, got to work at about 1020. My shift started at 0830 technically..... Basically that day I waited for an hour for a bus service that both I and the Customer Service guy at one of the bus stations thought was running, but wasn't. After I decided it wasn't running I was forced to try another route. I've been using that route to get to work since, but I've had to leave on the 0550 bus instead, in order to be at work on time. It "only" takes two hours to get there / back. On Saturday this bus doesn't run - the first one is the 0620 - so I was late for work on Saturday too.

Saturday I thought I would check the national rail website to check on the status of the trainline and find out when it would be back up, thinking it would hopefully be in the next few days. but oh no, oh shit, it's now estimated to be 6 - 8 weeks to repair the trainline.

crap crap crap crap crap. I've been ok with the travel method I've been using currently cos I thought it was short term. long term I just could not cope with it. These are the reasons:
<ol>
	<li>I've been travelling for four hours a day in total.</li>
	<li> It's more expensive than the train and involved three different bus companies, so I can't get a pass</li>
	<li> I have a Uni assignment due just after I return from Israel. Because I planned to A) be able to study on the train and B) have more time in general as traintravel to work takes less than an hour, including the biking component, I was planning to have it 90% done before I left for Israel. I have a week left before we go atm and and I have not started.</li>
	<li>As mentioned above, I was planning to study on the train. I can read on the train. On the bus I get very sick. So bus travel is Very Boring.</li>
	<li> All I do is work and eat and travel and sleep. What about fun, and more importantly seeing and spending time with my beloved?</li>
</ol>
Altogether this natural disaster has impacted me pretty annoyingly. I guess my house wasn't flooded, no one I know had their house flooded, and everyone I know is still alive. These are good, but it doesn't mean the flood hasn't had any adverse effects. (I nearly typed affects there. I'm ashamed.)

So, to get  on with the explanation of the semi-solution, I guess I need to divert to my birthday on friday. I had a great day, all things considered. It was the only day in the last week when I didn't have timekeeping issues because of the flooding (mon I left early, tues I didn't go, wed I didn't go, sat I was late...). I went to Morrison's with Mat (that is a different Mat(t) from down below. The earlier Matt was Matt H. The Mat in question shall be known as Mat D. I also have a third Matt I know, but he doesn't come into the story, for the moment at least.)  and got lots of cake-ey stuff to share with all.... When I got back someone said something congratulation-ey to me, and I said Huh? and checked my email. I was analyst of the month!!!!!!!!!! only third or fourth month in to a new contract, and considering how new I am to this type of role I was (am!) so so so so so so utterly pleased. It's like getting an A. I just rock. I also get rewarded with a Â£30 meal rebate for my lovelyness. 

So after the Utter Niftyness of the Analyst of the Month, the day progressed like normal. I had left my bike at work on monday and not really been able to get it home since then as I didn't know if my buses would accept a bike, even a lovely little foldy one. So I biked home. See <a href ="http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?f=d&hl=en&geocode=&saddr=worksop&daddr=Sheffield+Airport+Business+Park,+Europa+Link,+Norton,+Sheffield+S9,+United+Kingdom&mra=cc&dirflg=h&sll=53.362625,-1.26537&sspn=0.145667,0.32135&ie=UTF8&z=12&om=1"> Google Maps' idea of how to travel from Sheffield to Worksop</a>. It took two hours, including getting changed after work and getting lost. Hot damn. I have time to exercise again! Afterwards I found out I wasn't tired AND I still had energy, so we went out for a birthday meal at a new Oriental place in Worksop. It was Â£32. Nifty, a meal for only Â£2!

So have you figured out what I'm gonna try to do yet? Darren and I both agreed that trying to do this on my foldy on a regular basis would not be the greatest idea. So today we went to Halfords. We spent Â£400. I have BIG bike again, not a foldy!!!! yaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaayyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyy!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! yaaaaaaaaaayyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyy!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! wooooooooooooooooooooooohoooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! It's on finance like, and I got some other kit like a saddlebag thingy that will live on my bike and holds a repair kit and inner tube,  and two pairs of shorts. Lucky I epilated the other day. 

So after my driving lesson (which in itself was another story - at the end while I was trying to do some bay parking a young brat was riding his bike round and round and round my car - while I was REVERSING!!! does he want to die??? does he not see the <span style="color:red;font-weight:bold;">L</span> plates? I screwed up both times, and I blame him. Little idiot. I hope he gets splashed in a puddle.)  I went on a test ride, and learned how to user my weird flappy-paddle gear thingies. I've learned how to user them. Tomorrow I get up at 5:30 am again - but at least I get to exercise on the way to work instead of vegetating / dozing in a bus. Yech.
