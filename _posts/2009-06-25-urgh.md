I barely slept all night due to hayfever. Sneezes and tissues plugging nostrils even though i'd taken my antihistamine caused me much great fun and enjoyment. And now the train's late. Good morning world.

My legs ache badly from my walk yesterday too. At least that one's my fault. I'll probably upload pics this evening after work, providing I'm not napping....

Edit: Apparently cable theft is the culprit. First train that's running will be at 13:15... lucky I managed to book the day off work at short notice.

The day just got suckier, too. Our helpful neighbour (the one that has smoke the cat likes...) has mown his lawn, and our front lawn too. Bye, radishes. Bye, dwarf green beans. Dammit!!!!! 

I'm in a sulk right now. At least tomorrow I have nothing to do but read and eventually wind up in Bantry.
